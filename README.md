It is strongly recommended you create a dedicated virtual environment based on the `environment.yaml` file (e.g., using [`conda`](https://www.anaconda.com/), [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), `venv`, etc.) .


**Option 1** - using `Conda`:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yaml
```
