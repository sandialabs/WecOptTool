    "* Expanding the control state vector\n",

    "\n",

    "It rotates in pitch independently of the buoy, but is linked to the buoy through two parallel connections: the torsional spring and the generator.\n",
    "Since the flywheel is protected from wave loading by the buoy, it is **not** subject to hydrostatics or hydrodynamics.\n",
    "* **Spring**: The magnetic torsional spring provides positive stiffness to the flywheel.\n",
    "It has a linear displacement up to 45 degrees, at which point it \"wraps around\" and the stiffness begins decreasing.\n",
    "For simplicity, we will model the spring as strictly linear.\n",

    "Often, capturing nonlinear dynamics (such as due to constraints) requires a larger frequency range.\n",

    "Specifically, the PTO force has significant peaks around the excited frequency and at the 3rd harmonic (with a small peak at the 5th harmonic as well) which leads to peaks in the frequency spectrum of electrical power at the 2nd, 4th, and 6th harmonics.\n",
    "The frequency values are normalized in the plots below to more clearly show the harmonics.\n",
