    "* **Buoy**: As mentioned, this has the same basic geometric parameters as the WaveBot used in Tutorial 1. Since we're only modeling the pitch degree of freedom, we only need the pitch moment of inertia and not the mass of the buoy.\n",
    "* **Flywheel**: The flywheel is contained and dimensioned to fit on top of the buoy. It rotates in pitch independently of the buoy, but is linked to the buoy through two parallel connections: the torsional spring and the generator. Since the flywheel is protected from wave loading by the buoy, it is **not** subject to hydrostatics or hydrodynamics.\n",
    "* **Spring**: The magnetic torsional spring provides positive stiffness to the flywheel. It has a linear displacement up to 45 degrees, at which point it \"wraps around\" and the stiffness begins decreasing. For simplicity, we will model the spring as strictly linear. The spring is connected to a gearbox which makes the position of the spring (and therefore, the generator shaft) different from the relative position of the flywheel and buoy. \n",

The gear ratio of 3 was selected by the Pioneer team to keep the system in resonance considering the spring stiffness, moment of inertia of the flywheel, and the resonance frequency of the buoy. Try increasing the gear ratio or flywheel moment of inertia -- this will actually reduce the power generated since it will bring the effective stiffness of the flywheel out of resonance, causing less motion relative to the buoy.\n",
