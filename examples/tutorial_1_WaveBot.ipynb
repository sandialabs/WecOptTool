    "### Waves and WEC geometry\n",
    "The pseudo-spectral solution used in WecOptTool requires a specified set of frequencies to analyze.\n",
    "To model the WEC accurately, we need to ensure the set of selected frequencies captures the full hydrodynamic response range of the WEC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we start our WecOptTool model by defining this set of frequencies, the wave environment, and the mesh of the WEC geometry.\n",
    "This ensures the minimum wavelength in the selected frequencies is larger than the minimum wavelength that can be analyzed with the mesh using the Boundary Element Method (BEM), which we will do [later](#bem-solution).\n",
    "This is a good initial check to make sure the hydrodynamic properties results calculated with the BEM will be accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frequency selection\n",
    "To start with a simple case in this tutorial, we are interested in modeling a regular wave at 0.3 Hz.\n",
    "In regular waves, the linear WEC system response will always occur at the wave frequency, with the nonlinear system response also occurring at the corresponding odd harmonics (3rd, 5th, etc.) of the wave frequency.\n",
    "Thus, we can set the fundamental frequency in our set, $f_1$, equal to the wave frequency.\n",
    "Prior WaveBot analysis has found that the nonlinear dynamics are sufficiently captured with the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th harmonics.\n",
    "WecOptTool assumes the spacing between frequencies equals the magnitude of $f_1$. Therefore, we will model 10 frequencies to encompass these harmonics.\n",
    "\n",
    "These frequencies will be used for the Fourier representation of both the wave and the desired PTO force in the pseudo-spectral problem.\n",
    "See the [Theory](https://sandialabs.github.io/WecOptTool/theory.html) section of the WecOptTool documentation for more details on the pseudo-spectral problem formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to use the lowest number of frequencies possible while still maintaining accuracy in order to minimize degrees of freedom and computation time for the optimization solver."
