	abstract = {Ocean wave energy has significant technical potential but limited full-scale deployments and technology convergence. Consequently, guidelines for developing wave energy converters (WECs) are still developing themselves, especially around experimental uncertainty analysis (UA). To develop a comprehensive WEC-specific UA methodology, we conducted a 1:30 scale experiment of a case study oscillating water column (OWC) WEC. This paper presents the methodology, which describes UA principles and means to identify parameters causing uncertainty, and demonstrates new WEC-specific UA methods: general uncertainty analysis (GUA), the Monte Carlo method (MCM) for uncertainty propagation, and Type A and Type B uncertainty evaluation. Results show the expanded uncertainty averaged $\pm$ 16% for capture width ratio and $\pm$ 6% for wave loads; Type B uncertainty tended to be slightly larger than Type A uncertainty; and uncertainty in regular waves slightly larger than irregular waves. The MCM was found to be effective and efficient in uncertainty propagation. In general, given WECs tend to maximise motions, use a power take-off system, and must survive storms, WEC model tests may be especially susceptible to uncertainty due to nonlinearities and modelling complexities. In conclusion, UA should be carried out in WEC model test experiments. We close with recommendations for refining relevant international guidelines.},

	abstract = {Assessments of global wave power have been receiving increasing attention currently; however, a characterization of the global resources that holistically consider the different temporal scales that influence wave climate (monthly and seasonal, interannual and long-term) is still lacking. Moreover, the debate around the global figure of available resource is still widely open. This study provides a new global wave power assessment using a dataset that covers the period from 1948 to 2008, which was corrected using altimetry data and validated with buoys in terms of wave power. This study characterizes the mean wave power globally as well as its monthly and seasonal variability. Furthermore, it provides a link with the most relevant climate indices globally. The effect of the interannual variability is especially noteworthy for the Northern Hemisphere, where the seasonality is strongest. Additionally, we detect decadal long-term changes and determine that natural variability could explain a few of the differences found between decades. Lastly, we provide an assessment of the global theoretical wave power that covers the last six decades, compare approaches and estimates, and discuss factors of discrepancy. The global offshore wave power is estimated at 32,000TWh/yr, which is reduced to 16,000TWh/yr when considering the direction of the energy. The historical average change is 580TWh/decade. Our results indicate that the global natural variability could be a more relevant factor in the lifetime of wave farms than the historical long-term changes in wave energy.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper presents results from an investigation of global wave energy resources derived from analysis of wave climate predictions generated by the WAVEWATCH-III (NWW3) wind-wave model (Tolman, 2002) spanning the 10 year period from 1997 to 2006. The methodology that was followed to obtain these new results is described in detail. The spatial and temporal variations of the global wave energy resource are presented and described. Several parameters to describe and quantify the temporal variation of wave energy resources are presented and discussed. The new results are also validated through comparisons with energy estimates from buoy data and previous studies. INTRODUCTION Global warming, the Kyoto protocol, the depletion of conventional energy reserves and the rising cost of electricity generation have sparked renewed interest in renewable marine energy in many countries. Significant advances in wave energy converters have been made in recent years, and there is a growing realization in many countries, particularly those in Europe, that these technologies will be ready for large scale deployments within the next five to ten years. Despite these exciting developments, the potential wave energy resource in many parts of the world remains poorly defined. Pontes et al. (1997) observed that since the mid-1980s, numerical windwave models had been routinely producing good quality wave estimates and noted that these estimates are of great value for the assessment of offshore wave energy resources. They assessed the performance of two wind-wave models through comparison against buoy data, and selected the WAM model for use in the development of the WERATLAS, an atlas of European offshore wave energy resources. The WERATLAS is described in Pontes (1998). It includes a wide range of annual and seasonal wave climate and wave energy statistics for 85 offshore data points distributed along the Atlantic and Mediterranean European coasts.},

The fully assimilated FNL data provides accurate wind input for more reliable predictions of the wave conditions than the operational forecasts. The computed wave parameters show good correlation with Jason-1 altimetry and buoy measurements. The monthly median plots describe the seasonal variation of the global wave climate and the percentile plots indicate the persistence and severity of the wave conditions. Separate estimates of the power from the wind waves and primary swell provide a precise description of the resource in support of design and planning of wave energy converters.},

	abstract = {In this paper, technical and economical studies conducted on the SEAREV Wave Energy Converter (WEC) are presented. This technology was first proposed in 2002 with the aim of addressing critical challenges in wave energy conversion. It consists of a closed floating hull in which a heavy pendulum oscillates. The controlled relative motion of the pendulum is used to produce electricity. The SEAREV WEC was developed over twelve years. Through the development process, three main generations of the technology were defined and studied in detail. They are presented in the paper, showing how each new generation brought significant improvements over the previous generation with respect to production and costs. In 2013, an economical model for wave energy farms was developed to assess the viability and competitiveness of the SEAREV technology. Although results show that the SEAREV technology is a sound technical solution, the cost of energy projection is still too high to allow direct access to mass electricity market in European countries in the short term. Finally, in light of the lessons learned from the SEAREV WEC development, the need for innovative technologies with higher technology performance level (TPL) or alternative markets is discussed in the context of wave energy.},

	abstract = {To generate a substantial amount of power, Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are arranged in several rows or in a `farm'. Both the power production and cost of a farm are lay-out dependent. In this paper, the wave power redistribution in and around three farm lay-outs in a near shore North Sea wave climate, is assessed numerically using a time-dependent mild-slope equation model. The modelling of the wave power redistribution is an efficient tool to assess the power production of a farm. Further, for each lay-out an optimal (low cost) submarine cable network is designed. The methodology to assess the power production and cost of a farm of WECs is applied to the Wave Dragon Wave Energy Converter (WD--WEC). The WD--WEC is a floating offshore converter of the overtopping type, which captures the water volume of overtopped waves in a basin above mean sea level and produces power when the water drains back to the sea through hydro turbines. It is observed that the cable cost is relatively small compared to the cost of the WD--WECs. As a result, WD--WECs should be installed in a lay-out to increase power production rather than decrease cable cost, taking spatial and safety considerations into account. WD--WECs arranged in a single line produce the highest amount of power, but require an available sea area with a large width (51 km). Installing a single line of WD--WECs in front of a farm of wind turbines increases the time window for accessing the wind farm (applied to Horns Rev II -- significant wave height smaller than 1--2 m during 8 h at minimum) by 9--14%.},

This transformation will be necessary to meet environmental targets, to accommodate a greater emphasis on demand response (DR), and to support plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as well as distributed generation and storage capabilities. It is safe to say that these needs and changes present the power industry with the biggest challenge it has ever faced. On one hand, the transition to a smart grid has to be evolutionary to keep the lights on; on the other hand, the issues surrounding the smart grid are signifi cant enough to demand major changes in power systems operating philosophy.},

Power transmission utilities in the present days are more dependent on the standard designs for constructing transmission to minimize the capital cost. Economic studies indicate that transmission lines employing optimized designs and scientific cost management methodologies for construction are significant in achieving much higher savings in capital investments. The design and cost optimization of transmission lines is a complex aspect as various simultaneously interacting parameters are involved. Development of comprehensive cost models involving design parameters affecting the cost are required for modeling and cost optimization studies. The present study aims to review the broad areas of transmission line design and construction aspects; current status and trends in power transmission; challenges involved in construction, operation and maintenance of these lines and possible solutions for mitigating the challenges; methods applied for carrying out design and optimization studies; and finally, procedures adopted for economic analysis of transmission lines. An attempt has also been made to compare the various techniques applied for transmission line optimization studies and economic analysis methods.},

	abstract = {Currently there are the beginnings of a commercial wave energy industry and the ultimate ambition will be to deploy wave energy converters (WECs) in arrays, or wave farms, in a similar fashion to offshore wind. These arrays will require electrical networks to collect and export the generated electrical power to shore and onto the electrical grid. For large scale wind farms the inter-array and export electrical networks can represent more than 20% of the project's capital expenditure. Submarine power cables account for a large proportion of this cost. This cost proportion is expected to be the same for WEC arrays. This paper investigates strategies to reduce the cost of WEC array electrical networks by maximising the value of the network. The paper explores the possibility of underrating and dynamically rating the electrical array and export cable systems for WEC arrays in order to assess the cost savings that can be made. This paper will also look at a simulated WEC array power output time series. The aim is to establish whether the electrical equipment, particularly submarine cables, will operate outside its design parameters if under-rated based on maximum continuous current. This paper also investigates the WEC capacity factor effect on the overall economics of the array electrical system. It is concluded that cost savings could be made in the electrical network by utilising one, or a combination of, the outlined strategies. Understanding the potential benefits and applications of these strategies will assist in delivering cost effective WEC arrays in the future.},

The methodology consists of firstly, a productivity and costs assessment which embodies the operational simulations and secondly, a financial calculator which employs discounted cash-flow techniques to produce selected economic indicators.

	abstract = {Abstract In many engineering problems involving friction, the friction is treated as Coulomb friction, where the magnitude of the friction force is constant but its direction is always opposite to that of the sliding velocity. In dynamic problems, the direction of the sliding velocity can change quite often. The many changes of the velocity direction cause many discontinuities in the friction force, complicating the process of evaluating the response of systems involving friction. In this paper, it is shown that the discontinuous Coulomb friction force can be represented by at least four different continuous functions. Each of these functions involves one constant that controls the level of accuracy of that function's representation of the friction force. The accuracy of the various representations is verified by comparing the response of a single degree freedom system, obtained through numerical solutions utilizing these representations, with an exact analytical solution. {\copyright} 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Active control based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) methodology is applied to a candidate but realistic dual coaxial-cylinder wave-energy extractor system with the objective of maximizing energy capture over a range of incident ocean-wave conditions. The extractor consists of an outer cylinder (floater) moving relative to a tension-tethered inner cylinder, driving a permanent-magnet linear generator (PMLG) to acquire power take-off (PTO). The floater dynamics is solved in the time domain with the NMPC to constrain maximum floater motion and simultaneously incorporating the PMLG damping capability. The numerical model of the coupled floater and PTO dynamics is formulated in the state-space representation. The mechanical to electrical conversion efficiency of the PMLG, which was experimentally determined as a function of its power-extraction damping, is considered in the numerical simulation. The NMPC process yields a time-varying profile for the generator damping as the control strategy. Simulation results indicate strongly time-dependent and discontinuous generator-damping requirements for both regular and irregular incident-wave scenarios. However, the NMPC-controlled system significantly outperforms a passive-control, constant-damping system by exhibiting higher peak values of energy-extraction and a broader capturing bandwidth, thus confirming the feasibility and success of the control strategy.},

Currently, estimates are available for individual countries or, at low accuracy, for global resource. Additionally, existing estimates do not provide insight into potential future markets, i.e. the location of the resource. Here, NOAA WaveWatch III data are analysed for a 6-year period to calculate wave energy potential. The global market is then quantified by calculating the energy flux across a line 30 nautical miles offshore. Results are presented by country, continent, hemisphere and for the globe. Confidence values are also presented in the form of 95% confidence intervals. These limits provide insight into the uncertainty associated with the length of dataset used and the variability of the resource. This enables direct comparison with other resource assessment studies, whether using numerical model or measured data. An extensive survey of previous global and regional resource estimates is also conducted, in order to compare both results and methods. Supplementing this, extractable resource is estimated by considering the deployment of an illustrative WEC (Pelamis P2). The global wave power resource is 2.11 $\pm$ 0.05 TW, of which 4.6% is extractable with the chosen WEC configuration.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a shape-based approach to compute, in an optimal sense, the control of a single degree-of-freedom point absorber wave energy converter. In this study, it is assumed that a prediction for the wave is available. The control is computed so as to maximize the energy extraction over a future time horizon. In the shape-base approach, one of the system states is represented by a series expansion. The optimization variables are selected to be the coefficients in the series expansion instead of the history of the control variable. A gradient-based optimizer is used to optimize the series coefficients. The available wave prediction is used to compute an initial guess for the unknown series coefficients. This concept is tested on two different dynamic models: a simplified reduced-order model and a dynamic model with radiation dynamic states necessary to compute the radiation force. Several test cases are presented that cover a range of different sea states. The results show that the shape-based approach finds efficient solutions in terms of the extracted energy. The results also show that the obtained solutions are suitable for real-time implementation in terms of the smoothness of the obtained control and the speed of computations. Comparisons between the results of the shape-based approach and other techniques are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTMost control algorithms of wave energy converters require prediction of wave elevation or excitation force for a short future horizon, to compute the control in an optimal sense. This paper presents an approach that requires the estimation of the excitation force and its derivatives at present time with no need for prediction. An extended Kalman filter is implemented to estimate the excitation force. The measurements in this approach are selected to be the pressures at discrete points on the buoy surface, in addition to the buoy heave position. The pressures on the buoy surface are more directly related to the excitation force on the buoy as opposed to wave elevation in front of the buoy. These pressure measurements are also more accurate and easier to obtain. A singular arc control is implemented to compute the steady-state control using the estimated excitation force. The estimated excitation force is expressed in the Laplace domain and substituted in the control, before the latter is transformed to the time domain. Numerical simulations are presented for a Bretschneider wave case study.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates optimal active control schemes applied to a point absorber wave energy converter within a receding horizon fashion. A variational formulation of the power maximization problem is adapted to solve the optimal control problem. The optimal control method is shown to be of a bang-bang type for a power takeoff mechanism that incorporates both linear dampers and active control elements. We also consider a direct transcription of the optimal control problem as a general nonlinear program. A variation of the projected gradient optimization scheme is formulated and shown to be feasible and computationally inexpensive compared to a standard NLP solver. Since the system model is bilinear and the cost function is not convex quadratic, the resulting optimization problem is not a quadratic program. Results will be compared with an optimal command latching method to demonstrate the improvement in absorbed power. All time domain simulations are generated under irregular sea conditions.},

	type = {{PhD}},
	year = {2012},
	abstract = {The first objective of this work was the development of numerical tools, to analyse the dynamics of Wave Energy Converters {WECs}, based on frequency and time domain approaches. The frequency model developed is based on an entirely linear hydrodynamic interaction between the {WEC} and ocean waves as well as any external force on the {WEC}, including the force impinged by the power-take-off equipment {PTO}, which is fairly acceptable within the device operational regime where the waves and device oscillations are, in general, described by low amplitude motions. So, in the frequency domain, all the physical quantities vary sinusoidally with time, according to the frequency of the sinusoidal incident wave. Thus, the model allows to describe the device dynamics in terms of motion (velocities or accelerations) complex amplitudes for specified linear {PTO} characterizations, and, consequently, to estimate the mean power absorption. However, in many practical cases, the {WEC} dynamics has some parts which are strongly non-linear, and so, the superposition principle is no longer applicable. Those cases may be the nonlinear forces induced by the mooring system and the {PTO} designed for a specific control strategy. Hence, a correct analysis of the problem has to be done in the time domain. For this reason a time domain model covering the entire energy conversion chain (wave-to-wire model) was developed by means of a generic approach in order to extend its applicability to study different technologies. Besides the development of numerical tools, an application to analyse the dynamics of an axisymmetric floating {OWC} was also part of this work. Therefore, the frequency model was used to characterize the device in terms of shape and size, since one of the main model outputs is the mean absorption level. From this study several considerations related to the design of heaving axisymmetric point absorbers came out. Moreover, the wave-to-wire code was applied to study the dynamics response of the floating {OWC} under two different control strategies, in order to bound the device capability to absorb wave energy. The first one consists of a {PTO} whose performance is equivalent to a damper of uniform coefficient, which corresponds to the poorest energy absorption state. Further, a control strategy based on an entirely predictive control was also implemented in order to characterize the device performance under the most suitable energy absorption condition. This approach enables a clear idea to be obtained about the quality of any further control strategy applied.},

In essence the time domain model is based on the second Newton{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s law, which states that the inertial force is balanced by the whole forces acting over the {WEC{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s} captor. Thus, the entire force is decomposed into hydrodynamic and external sources. The hydrodynamic source comprises the excitation force, inflicted by the incident waves, the buoyancy and the radiation force. In addition, the device motion is also constrained by external forces induced by both the {PTO} equipment and the mooring system. Besides the model implementation, some results concerning the code verification are presented. The code verification has been done by using analytical solutions of simple cases, as the dynamics of cylinders, along with the knowledge of the behavior of floating bodies in some particular conditions as, for instance, the dynamic response under regular waves for the limiting cases of infinite and zero frequency.},

	abstract = {Time-domain modelling of wave-energy devices is an important step in the design and evaluation of potential devices and to provide a basis for model-based control design. This is due to the need for information on the device's transient response characteristics; even when linear potential theory is assumed when modelling hydrodynamic loads, significant non-linearities may be present in the system due to the power-take-off (PTO), mooring, and control subsystems. In this paper, an approach for modelling multi-body marine systems is presented. Newton--Euler equations with eliminated constraints (NE-EC) are utilised to capture the rigid-body dynamics of the constrained multi-body system. This results in the convenient integration of active loads (as opposed to inter-body constraint forces) acting on the multi-body system and provides a form suitable for control design. This paper considers active loads originating from hydrodynamic, PTO, and mooring components. The model developed is validated on a two-body system and is shown to have good agreement across the range of important operational frequencies.},

The first method is based on the analytical solution of the equation of motion of the Wave Energy Converter ({WEC)} in the time domain, using matrix exponentials; it can be used to compute the optimal latching delay. The second one derives from optimal command theory; it is based on a hamiltonian formulation and Pontryagin{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s maximum principle. A weak modelling is used to describe latching control prior to applying the optimal command theory. These methods are applied to two different {WECs.} The first one is a generic one degree of freedom wave energy converter, an heaving buoy, and the second one is the four degrees of freedom wave energy converter called {SEAREV.} It is shown that latching control based on optimal command theory applied to this weak formulation is not fully optimal in regular waves. However, it can be used to generate optimally controlled time domain sequences of the {WEC}{\^{A}}{~}motions in a random sea, and so it provides an answer to the question: what is the maximum benefit latching control could bring to my wave energy device in a random sea?},

	abstract = {This paper investigates semi-analytically the latching control applied to a mechanical oscillator; and numerically three strategies of latching control for a point absorber wave energy converter oscillating in the heave mode only. By solving the equation of motion of a mechanical damped oscillator, it is shown that latching control can magnify the amplitude of the motion whatever the frequency of the excitation force, and how it can improve the efficiency of the system, in term of absorbed energy, for excitation frequencies apart from the natural frequency. Assuming that the excitation force is known in the close future and that the body is locked in position at the current time step, equations of motion of the body are solved numerically in the time domain for different initial conditions (i.e. latching durations). For all these simulations, three criteria{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}one for each strategy{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}are tested and the latching time leading to the best result is selected. Time domain simulation results are presented for a heaving buoy in small-amplitude regular and random waves. In regular waves, the same results as for the case of a mechanical oscillator are recovered for the wave energy converter. In random sea, results show that for all the three proposed strategies, efficiency of the wave energy converter is considerably improved in terms of absorbed energy. Numerical study of the period of the controlled system shows that the delay of prediction of the excitation force in the future seems to be bounded by the natural period of the system.},

	abstract = {When hydraulic power take off ({PTO)} is used to convert the mechanical energy of a wave energy converter ({WEC)} into a more useful form of energy, the {PTO} force needs to be controlled. Continuous controlled variation of the {PTO} force can be approximated by a set of discrete values. This can be implemented using either variable displacement pumps or several hydraulic cylinders or several high pressure accumulators with different pressure levels. This pseudo-continuous control could lead to a complex {PTO} with a lot of components. A simpler way for controlling this hydraulic {PTO} is declutching control, which consists in switching on and off alternatively the wave energy converter's {PTO.} This can be achieved practically using a simple by-pass valve. In this paper, the control law of the valve is determined by using the optimal command theory. It is shown that, theoretically when considering a wave activated body type of {WEC}, declutching control can lead to energy absorption performance at least equivalent to that of pseudo-continuous control. The method is then applied to the case of the {SEAREV} wave energy converter, and it is shown than declutching control can even lead to a higher energy absorption, both in regular and irregular waves.},

	abstract = {Abstract It is well known in the literature that the total absorbed energy of a farm of wave energy converter depends, within a wide range of variability, on the hydrodynamic interaction between the individual devices. Several studies have addressed the problem of controlling the wave energy converters so as to exploit the positive interaction between the devices in order to increase the total amount of absorbed energy. This paper studies two types of control systems for array of wave energy converters: the first is similar to the classical optimal control which uses the complete (linear) hydrodynamic model of the array and information about the status (velocity) of the other devices, while the second is a suboptimal control systems which calculates the optimal motion while neglecting completely the interaction between the devices. Most importantly the comparison is carried out considering the effects of constraints on the maximum allowed oscillation amplitude and \{PTO\} force.},

The main objective is to design a control system suitable for real-time implementation. The method presented for the solution of the optimization problem is based on the approximation of the motion of the device and of the force exerted by the power take off unit by means of a linear combination of basis functions. The result is that the optimal control problem is reformulated as a non linear program where the properties of the cost function and of the constraint are affected by the choice of the basis functions. An example is described where the motion and the force are approximated using Fourier series; an optimization algorithm for the solution of the non linear program is also presented. The control system is implemented and simulated using a real sea profile measured by a waverider buoy.},

Numerical simulations of actual dynamical models for both point absorbers and directionally sensitive devices employing practical control strategies show that most of this potential can actually be realised. The control of large scale wave farms using quiescent period predictive control is likely to be most cost effective using master/slave {WEC} systems. To achieve the computational savings that will allow this strategy analytic approximations are required for the response of {WECs} with time varying coefficients, preliminary forms of these have also been introduced.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide such a comparison. Identified techniques are the {NewWave}, constrained {NewWave} and optimised sea, all based on sea spectra. A particular focus is the usefulness of each technique for modelling a travelling vessel encountering an abnormal wave. Experimental results are presented for each model compared to linear and second order wave theories, and the quality of results is assessed using an uncertainty analysis. Results demonstrate the constrained {NewWave} is highly repeatable, but suffers from discrepancies in the time domain when compared to predicted profiles. In order to generate a known wave profile, the {NewWave} or optimisation techniques appear the most suitable. Of these, {NewWave} should be used if only the local (abnormal) wave profile is required. To model a realistic scenario including the response history of a vessel, the optimised sea should be applied.},

The nature of ocean waves is strongly irregular and the power generation from a Wave Energy Converter will have large fluctuations what is a challenge for the electrical system. In the history of wave energy research the focus has been on controlling devices for increasing the absorbed power based on results from mechanical and hydrodynamic mathematical analysis. However, recent work shows that the peak of produced power increases compared to the average absorbed power when traditional control strategies like passive loading and optimal control are applied. The rating and the energy storage requirements of the electrical system will then be increased and the gain due to the increased power production might be lost. In recent work a control strategy that optimizes the torque of the generator with respect to a power saturation level is presented. The work in this report focuses on a practical implementation of this strategy. Further, modifications to meet the torque and speed limitations of the system are made. A control algorithm is presented that utilizes the overrated speed region of the generator to maximize the power production with regards to the power and torque ratings. Simulations for irregular waves and control parameters chosen according to passive loading are then executed and the control algorithm is realized by use of field oriented control of the induction generator. The average absorbed power is changed only to moderate extends compared to the unconstrained case. At the same time the peak to average ratio and the maximum torque is considerably reduced. However, the strategy{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s reduced torque capability results in a higher maximum speed and pull out speed can be reached. Consequently there will be a trade off between investment costs, produced power and operation range of the system. Therefore the system should be optimized with respect to torque and power limitations, costs, produced power and pullout speed.},

	abstract = {By actively controlling the rotation of its pendulum, a vertical axis pendulum wave energy converter can generate significantly more net electricity from ocean waves than what would otherwise be possible through a passively swinging pendulum. This suggests that such converters can optimize their performance by incorporating active control schemes within their ever-- changing ocean wave environment. The challenge of implementing such control, however, necessitates that an active controller be developed. Here, we address such challenges by: (i) deriving the equations of motion for a constrained generic vertical axis pendulum wave energy converter; (ii) modeling an irregular ocean wave environment; (iii) developing a model predictive and integral error tracking controller to enforce a desired control strategy; and (iv) simulating the converter within the modeled wave environment both with and without active control for the purpose of comparing their respective net power generation results. Here, we find that by actively controlling the rotation of the converter's pendulum, both continuous--mean and peak power generation are increased significantly. Simulation results show that active control is capable of increasing continuous--mean net power generation by over 200 percent. These results give strong evidence and support for further vertical axis pendulum wave energy converter development and also for the continued investigation of applying such active controllers to real world scenarios and prototypes.},

This Wave Energy Converter (WEC) is a particular style of Oscillating Water Column (OWC). The methodology details how to decompose the BBDB into a series of \#x2018;hydrodynamic bodies \#x2019; to account for inertial and viscous effects, \#x2018;structural bodies \#x2019; to account for structural mass and inertia, and freely flooding bodies to account for the time dependent variation of entrained water mass in the OWC of the device. Separating these effects allows for independent treatment of the phenomena being modeled and for an easily adaptable WEC model. Because effects of the PTO can be eliminated when considering extreme conditions, OrcaFlex, a validated mooring time domain solver, is applied to this problem. Thus coupled analysis between the proposed mooring system design and the BBDB dynamic response allows for mooring system component specification. Due to the dependence of Morison Equation force magnitudes on empirically derived drag coefficients, the paper concludes with a study quantifying the effect of drag coefficient magnitude on survival mooring loads.},

A new resonance results from coupling the floating structure to the air-column that is unique from the uncoupled resonance location.

	abstract = {This paper describes the steps for building the time domain model of an ocean waves energy converter device called {AWS} (Archimedes wave swing). This model is useful for the design of such devices and for the prediction of its behavior in different sea conditions. Besides the inherent complexity associated to the nonlinear dynamics of the {AWS} components, for time domain simulation, a convolution integral is conventionally used to model the hydrodynamic diffraction and radiation forces, being the last one characterized in the frequency domain by the added mass and damping. However, this integral is relatively expensive to evaluate and difficult to use with efficient integration routines. Here, an efficient methodology mixing frequency-and time-domains is introduced to deal with this problem. The wave transfer functions were first obtained from a numerical finite element code, as vectors containing the frequency response of the desired transfer functions. The data obtained is then used to identify the corresponding analytic form of the transfer functions, which is integrated in the time-domain model. The model includes the slow and fast dynamics of the {AWS} behavior.},

	abstract = {Wave-energy point absorbers can be defined as oscillators excited by ocean waves. Devices of this kind are meant to be deployed offshore for the production of renewable energy. As wave conditions at a given site can vary widely over time, advanced control strategies for point absorbers are required to guarantee good performance. This article presents a state-space control scheme for a point absorber, which builds on an approach outlined in an earlier article by the same authors. Strongly based on model predictive control (MPC), the control scheme makes use of an unusual form of the objective function, and aims at maximising the production of energy by the point absorber. The control scheme remedies some of the shortcomings of existing approaches to the control of a point absorber, such as reactive control and latching control, and is meant to be extendable to any point absorber that can be well described by a linear model. Results of numerical simulations of a heaving point absorber controlled with this scheme are presented and confirm the potential of this approach.},

It is assumed that the solutions of the corresponding steady-state time-harmonic radiation and diffraction problems are available. It is proposed to fit the frequency responses associated with the `radiation impedance' and wave-exciting forces with appropriate analytic functions. In the case of the radiation problem, these possess certain properties corresponding to the passivity of the radiation mapping. By choosing rational approximations, the transformation from the frequency to the time domain is facilitated. The method is illustrated for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems using a floating cylinder, sphere, and a model of Salter's Duck which exhibits hydrodynamic coupling between sway, heave, and pitch motions.},

The buoy is cylindrical, has a diameter of 3.3 m, and the height is, at equilibrium, 3.1 m below mean water level and 2.0 m above. A valve in the machinery can be actively controlled, and it is used to obtain largest possible power production, and to limit the excursion of the buoy, in order to protect the hydraulic machinery. In addition, an end-stop device is provided as a safety measure, in case the control fails to limit the excursion. For comparison a quite similar hydraulic machinery, without active control, is also investigated. A procedure is developed for control in irregular waves, and on the basis of a scatter table the year-average power production is estimated to be approximately 14.7 {kW} for the buoy with control and 5.3 {kW} for the buoy without control. Further, a duration curve is presented, which shows that for the buoy with control the mean power production is between 10 {kW} and 20 {kW} more than 70\% of the year. For the buoy without control more than half of the annual energy output is obtained in less than 20\% of the time. This shows that control will both increase the mean power production, and give a much more smooth output. The procedure is also reasonably successful in limiting the excursion, so that the end-stop device is not in regular operation.}}

	abstract = {Oscillating bodies constitute an important class of wave energy converters, especially for offshore deployment. Phase control by latching has been proposed in the 1970s to enhance the wave energy absorption by oscillating bodies (especially the so-called point absorbers). Although this has been shown to be potentially capable of substantially increasing the amount of absorbed energy, the practical implementation in real irregular waves of optimum phase control has met with theoretical and practical difficulties that have not been satisfactorily overcome. The present paper addresses the case of oscillating-body converters equipped with a high-pressure hydraulic power take-off mechanism ({PTO)} that provides a natural way of achieving latching: the body remains stationary for as long as the hydrodynamic forces on its wetted surface are unable to overcome the resisting force (gas pressure difference times cross-sectional area of the ram) introduced by the hydraulic {PTO} system. A method of achieving sub-optimal phase-control is developed, based on the theoretical time-domain modelling of a single-degree of freedom oscillating body in regular and irregular waves, by adequately delaying the release of the body in order to approximately bring into phase the body velocity and the diffraction (or excitation) force on the body, and in this way get closer to the well-known optimal condition derived from frequency-domain analysis for an oscillating body in regular waves.},

Energy is converted from the relative motion between the piston and the buoy-tube pair. The modelling is performed in the frequency domain (including reactive phase control), in order to provide some kind of geometry optimization, and also in the time-domain to allow the simulation of a more realistic high-pressure-oil power take-off system.}}

In this paper wave spectrum parameters related to transport, distribution and variability of wave energy in the sea are educed. Many different types of wave-energy converters, of various categories, have been proposed. It is useful to think of primary conversion of wave energy by an oscillating system as a wave-interference phenomenon. Corresponding to optimum wave interference, there is an upper bound to the amount of energy that can be extracted from a wave by means of a particular oscillating system. Taking physical limitations into account, another upper bound, for the ratio of extracted energy to the volume of the immersed oscillating system, has been derived. Finally, the significance of the two different upper bounds is discussed.},

	abstract = {Absorption of wave energy may be considered as a phenomenon of interference between incident and radiated waves generated by an oscillating object; a wave-energy converter (WEC) that displaces water. If a WEC is very small in comparison with one wavelength, it is classified as a point absorber (PA); otherwise, as a `quasi-point absorber'. The latter may be a dipole-mode radiator, for instance an immersed body oscillating in the surge mode or pitch mode, while a PA is so small that it should preferably be a source-mode radiator, for instance a heaving semi-submerged buoy. The power take-off capacity, the WEC's maximum swept volume and preferably also its full physical volume should be reasonably matched to the wave climate. To discuss this matter, two different upper bounds for absorbed power are applied in a `Budal diagram'. It appears that, for a single WEC unit, a power capacity of only about 0.3 MW matches well to a typical offshore wave climate, and the full physical volume has, unfortunately, to be significantly larger than the swept volume, unless phase control is used. An example of a phase-controlled PA is presented. For a sizeable wave-power plant, an array consisting of hundreds, or even thousands, of mass-produced WEC units is required.},

Following recent controversy, the corresponding three optional expressions are derived, compared and discussed in this paper. They all provide the correct time-average absorbed power. However, only the first-mentioned expression is applicable to quantify the instantaneous absorbed wave power and the associated reactive power. In this connection, new formulae are derived that relate the {\textquoteleft}added-mass{\textquoteright} matrix, as well as a couple of additional reactive radiation-parameter matrices, to the difference between kinetic energy and potential energy in the water surrounding the immersed oscillating WEC array. Further, a complex collective oscillation amplitude is introduced, which makes it possible to derive, by a very simple algebraic method, various simple expressions for the maximum time-average wave power that may be absorbed by the WEC array. The real-valued time-average absorbed power is illustrated as an axisymmetric paraboloid defined on the complex collective-amplitude plane. This is a simple illustration of the so-called {\textquoteleft}fundamental theorem for wave power{\textquoteright}. Finally, the paper also presents a new derivation that extends a recently published result on the direction-average maximum absorbed wave power to cases where the WEC array{\textquoteright}s radiation damping matrix may be singular and where the WEC array may contain OWCs in addition to oscillating bodies.},

	abstract = {Large-scale commercial exploitation of wave energy is certain to require the deployment of wave energy converters ({WECs)} in arrays, creating {{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textasciitilde}WEC} farms{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}. An understanding of the hydrodynamic interactions in such arrays is essential for determining optimum layouts of {WECs}, as well as calculating the area of ocean that the farms will require. It is equally important to consider the potential impact of wave farms on the local and distal wave climates and coastal processes; a poor understanding of the resulting environmental impact may hamper progress, as it would make planning consents more difficult to obtain. It is therefore clear that an understanding the interactions between {WECs} within a farm is vital for the continued development of the wave energy {industry.To} support {WEC} farm design, a range of different numerical models have been developed, with both wave phase-resolving and wave phase-averaging models now available. Phase-resolving methods are primarily based on potential flow models and include semi-analytical techniques, boundary element methods and methods involving the mild-slope equations. Phase-averaging methods are all based around spectral wave models, with supra-grid and sub-grid wave farm models available as alternative {implementations.The} aims, underlying principles, strengths, weaknesses and obtained results of the main numerical methods currently used for modelling wave energy converter arrays are described in this paper, using a common framework. This allows a qualitative comparative analysis of the different methods to be performed at the end of the paper. This includes consideration of the conditions under which the models may be applied, the output of the models and the relationship between array size and computational effort. Guidance for developers is also presented on the most suitable numerical method to use for given aspects of {WEC} farm design. For instance, certain models are more suitable for studying near-field effects, whilst others are preferable for investigating far-field effects of the {WEC} farms. Furthermore, the analysis presented in this paper identifies areas in which the numerical modelling of {WEC} arrays is relatively weak and thus highlights those in which future developments are required.},

An experimental program was carried out with a scaled model in a seakeeping tank. The experimental data is systematically compared with numerical results from a nonlinear time domain strip method in order to assess the capability of the method to estimate extreme vertical responses. The analysis of discrepancies between measurements and predictions indicates how the numerical model can be improved. The experimental results are also compared in terms of maximum responses induced by the design storms and induced by an abnormal wave. The objective is to conclude about the relevance of abnormal waves with regard to extreme bending moments. Finally the maximum bending moments, measured and calculated for the North Sea climate, are compared with the rule minimum requirements.},

	abstract = {Abstract Wave energy converters ({WECs)} based on oscillating bodies or oscillating water columns would earn huge benefits from a time-domain control on a wave by wave basis. Such a control would allow efficient energy extraction over a wider range of frequencies than what could possibly be achieved when no real-time control is adopted, thus increasing the economical attractiveness of the {WECs.} Almost every control strategy that showed some potential, however, suffers from the problem that future knowledge of the incident wave elevation, or wave excitation force, is required. In this paper a general control framework for oscillating {WECs} is presented and a methodology to understand and quantify the wave excitation force prediction requirements, along with the achievable prediction accuracy, is discussed. The two features are compared against each other and linked to the dynamic characteristics of a device. Along with the qualitative discussion, the methodology is applied to some heaving cylinders when reactive control and linear passive control are applied, under different sea conditions.},

The controller tunes the oscillation of the system such that it is always in phase with the wave excitation force and the amplitude of the oscillation is within given constraints. Based on a nonstationary, harmonic approximation of the wave excitation force, the controller is easily tuned in real-time for performance and constraints handling, through one single parameter of direct physical meaning. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is assessed for a heaving system in one degree of freedom, in a variety of irregular (simulated and real) wave conditions. A performance close to reactive control and to model predictive control is achieved. Additional benefits in terms of simplicity and robustness are obtained.},

on. The relative motion between
the floating body and the moving mass is used to drive a generator v

of-freedom motions under the action of incoming waves. The dynamic and st
atic components of the
non-linear Froude-Krylov forces are computed on the instantaneous wetted
surface under the incident
wave profile. A linear time-domain model is applied to compute the f
irst-order of the radiation and
diffraction forces. These forces are developed to the second-order by
using Taylor expansion. The
quadratic component of the Bernoulli{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s equation is added by convolution. The tes

solution. Comparisons with

Wave energy converters are employed to harness this energy and convert it into usable electrical energy. However, in order to efficiently extract the energy, the wave energy converter must be optimised in the design stage. Therefore, in this paper, a methodology is presented which aims to optimise the structural geometric configuration of the device to maximise the average power extraction from its intended deployment site. Furthermore, a case study of the Atlantic marine energy test site, off the west coast of Ireland, is undertaken in order to demonstrate the methodology. Using the average annual wave energy spectrum at this site as the input, the optimum structural geometric configuration was established, along with an analysis of the optimum configuration for different radius devices. In addition, the optimum damping coefficient of the \{PTO\} mechanism is determined and the total mean absorbed power for the structure at the site over the entire scatter diagram of data is calculated.},

The tests included a various range of incoming waves, from small regular waves to storm conditions irregular waves. The numerical simulations have been performed at the {WavEC} using an in-house time-domain model. The code, based on the linear potential theory, solves the system of motion equations using state-space representations of the radiation terms and includes nonlinear hydrostatic forces and nonlinear Froude-Krylov excitation terms, which require the instantaneous detection of the floating body wetted surface. The idea behind this approach is first to increase the model accuracy (compared to the fully linear model method), but also to keep the computational time relatively {low.Results} show a good agreement between experimental and numerical data, which enhance significantly the confidence in using such sort of models to simulate the behavior of wave energy converters.},

The wave energy converter, which is under development by the Swedish company CorPower Ocean, is designed with a passive pneumatic machinery component referred to as WaveSpring, invented at NTNU. The negative spring arrangement inherently provides phase control. The power take off system and the effect of the phase-enhancement component was represented by a motor rig run with a force-feedback controller. Responses with and without the WaveSpring unit were measured in order to compare performance in terms of motions, loads and power absorption. The experiments included decay tests, radiation tests, irregular wave tests with the system in normal operation, as well as extreme wave tests with the system in survival mode. The power was extracted through a linear damping force, where the damping coefficients were set close to their theoretical optimum for the heave mode. The results show that with the WaveSpring component, the system is able to absorb three times more power in realistic sea conditions than without it. This is achieved without increasing the damping force, thus giving a three times higher ratio of absorbed energy to \{PTO\} force. The maximum mooring line tension in storm conditions is found to be less than 2.5 times the pretension force.},

	abstract = {Current prognoses are that, unless counteracted by very strong political measures, the world will meet both energy shortage and climate crisis within a horizon of a few decades, both of which are strongly related to our dependence on fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources may be harvested sustainably, and developing technology for their exploitation therefore forms an obvious part of strategies to reduce emissions and secure energy supply. Wave energy is a resource with relatively high power density, readily available along the coasts, and thus coinciding with the areas where industry and people tend to be accumulated. In some regions this resource is large enough to form a significant part of the energy mix. The technology for harnessing the power of ocean waves is today still on the research and development stage. The challenge is to make a design where the costs of investment, operation and maintenance (in terms of money, resources and energy) can be justified by the availability and potential earnings. This thesis focuses on two aspects of systems for wave energy conversion: How to model such systems, which is important for understanding and design, and how to control their motion, which is crucial for the primary power conversion {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft} the inevitable step that forms the basis for revenues and energy output from such a device. The dissertation is based on articles published in scientific conferences and journals, as well as an account for background of the undertaken research and the methods used. The bond graph modelling language has been chosen as a promising aid for the modelling of the power converter dynamics. It enables a systematic and transparent approach to the path from drawing board to mathematical equations. Examples show how energy conversion systems may be modelled and simulated within this framework. These include heave-motion models for a semi-submerged sphere, a platform/buoy two-body system and a smallscale oscillating water column ({OWC)}, as well as wave-to-wire models of two made-up systems. The {OWC} model was also studied by laboratory experiments. A range of control strategies has been studied and compared by numerical simulation, and in one case also by laboratory experiments. These strategies include phase control by latching and by clutching, approximations to complex-conjugate control, and model predictive control ({MPC).} Constraint handling and real-time parameter tuning are discussed, too. The constrained optimal power absorption is investigated, and for the example of a semi-submerged heaving sphere in irregular waves it is found that {MPC} in combination with a Kalman filter predictor is able to provide an absorbed power in excess of 90\% as compared to the non-causal (and hence not completely realisable) constrained optimum. Other causal controller implementations gives an absorbed power ranging from 10 to 90\% of that achieved with {MPC.} The best performing control strategies, however, involve a large flow of reactive power through the machinery, which in normal irregular-wave operation may give peak-to-average power ratio as high as 25 and above. This represents a challenge to the design of machinery and controller. An interesting observation from the numerical simulations is the possibility of increased absorbed power in irregular waves as compared to regular waves having about the same wavelength characteristics and the same wave power level. An explanation is suggested for this phenomenon.},

	abstract = {The question of optimal operation of wave-energy converters has been a key issue since modern research on the topic emerged in the early 1970s, and criteria for maximum wave-energy absorption soon emerged from frequency domain analysis. However, constraints on motions and forces give the need for time-domain modeling, where numerical optimization must be used to exploit the full absorption potential of an installed converter. A heaving, semisubmerged sphere is used to study optimal constrained motion of wave-energy converters. Based on a linear model of the wave-body interactions, a procedure for the optimization of the machinery force is developed and demonstrated. Moreover, a model-predictive controller is defined and tested for irregular sea. It repeatedly solves the optimization problem online in order to compute the optimal constrained machinery force on a receding horizon. The wave excitation force is predicted by use of an augmented Kalman filter based on a damped harmonic oscillator model of the wave process. It is shown how constraints influence the optimal motion of the heaving wave-energy converter, and also how close it is possible to approach previously published theoretical upper bounds. The model-predictive controller is found to perform close to optimum in irregular waves, depending on the quality of the wave force predictions. An absorbed power equal to or larger than 90\% of the ideal constrained optimum is achieved for a chosen range of realistic sea states. Under certain circumstances, the optimal wave-energy absorption may be better in irregular waves than for a corresponding regular wave having the same energy period and wave-power level. An argument is presented to explain this observation.},

Non-ideal (Kalman filter prediction) increases for prediction horizons less than half of the eigen period and decreases for prediction horizons greater than half of the eigen period. The former effect is due to better foreknowledge, and the latter due to compounding error of the Kalman filter.5.) Non-ideal performance with a prediction horizon near the eigen period relative to the ideal performance (perfect prediction with a prediction horizon of twice the eigen period) is around 0.95, a very small decrease.{\^A} In general, this paper's results imply that model predictive control has promise for increasing {WEC} {efficiencyCaveat:} This study reports prediction horizons w.r.t. the eigen period of the {WEC} model in question (T0 = 4.4s).

	abstract = {Wave-energy converters of the point-absorbing type (i.e., having small extension compared with the wavelength) are promising for achieving cost reductions and design improvements because of a high power-to-volume ratio and better possibilities for mass production of components and devices as compared with larger converter units. However, their frequency response tends to be narrow banded, which means that the performance in real seas (irregular waves) will be poor unless their motion is actively controlled. Only then the invested equipment can be fully exploited, bringing down the overall energy cost. In this work various control methods for point-absorbing devices are reviewed, and a representative selection of methods is investigated by numerical simulation in irregular waves, based on an idealized example of a heaving semisubmerged sphere. Methods include velocity-proportional control, approximate complex conjugated control, approximate optimal velocity tracking, phase control by latching and clutching, and model-predictive control, all assuming a wave pressure measurement as the only external input to the controller. The methods are applied for a single-degree-of-freedom heaving buoy. Suggestions are given on how to implement the controllers, including how to tune control parameters and handle amplitude constraints. Based on simulation results, comparisons are made on absorbed power, reactive power flow, peak-to-average power ratios, and implementation complexity. Identified strengths and weaknesses of each method are highlighted and explored. It is found that overall improvements in average absorbed power of about 100{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}330\% are achieved for the investigated controllers as compared with a control strategy with velocity-proportional machinery force. One interesting finding is the low peak-to-average ratios resulting from clutching control for wave periods about 1.5 times the resonance period and above.},

	abstract = {The transient elastic deformation of a pontoon-type very large floating structure ({VLFS)} caused by the landing and take-off of an airplane is computed by the time-domain mode-expansion method. The memory effects in hydrodynamic forces are taken into account, and great care is paid to numerical accuracy in evaluating all the coefficients appearing in the simultaneous differential equations for the elastic motion of a {VLFS.} The time-histories of the imparted force and the position and velocity of an airplane during landing and take-off are modeled with data from a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet. Simulation results are shown of 3-D structural waves on a {VLFS} and the associated unsteady drag force on an airplane, which is of engineering importance, particularly during take-off. The results for landing show that the airplane moves faster than the structural waves generated in the early stage, and the waves overtake the airplane as its speed decreases to zero. The results for take-off are essentially the same as those for landing, except that the structural waves develop slowly in the early stage, and no obstacle exists on the runway after the take-off of airplane. The additional drag force on an airplane due to the elastic responses of the runway considered in this work was found to be small in magnitude.},

The current work is intended to develop a fast and accurate method capable of long term simulations of ship in a seaway from which statistical properties of impact loads can be derived. This procedure includes an approximation method based on Momentum Theory enhanced with pile-up effects due to the immersing bow and the draft dependent static bow wave. It is shown that the latter effects are crucial for a good prediction of the impact force. The method is tuneable to specific ship characteristics, but it captures the effect of different wave conditions and different headings well. The tuning can be done using a dedicated set of experiments, either in the towing tank or by {CFD.} The {CFD} option is illustrated with a calculation in head seas showing a very good agreement of the force on the bow and of local pressures to experiments.},

Optimal control for maximum energy conversion requires independent synthesis of the impulse response functions corresponding to these two quantities. Since both are non-causal (one being odd and other even), full cancellation of reactive forces and matching of radiation damping requires knowledge or estimation of device velocity into the future. To address this difficulty and the non-causality of the exciting force impulse response function, this paper investigates the use of propagating-wave surface elevation up-wave of the device to synthesize the necessary forces. Long-crested waves are assumed, and the approach is based on the formulations of Naito and Nakamura [2] and Falnes [22]. A predominantly heaving submerged device comprised of three vertically stacked discs driving a linear power take-off is studied. The overall formulation leads to smooth control that is near-optimal, given the approximations involved in the time-shifting of the non-causal impulse response functions and the consequent up-wave distances at which wave surface elevation is required. Absorbed power performance with the near-optimal approach is compared with two other cases, (i) when single-frequency tuning is used based on non-real time adjustment of the reactive and resistive loads to maximize conversion at the spectral peak frequency, and (ii) when no control is applied with damping set to a constant value. Simulation results for wave spectra over a range of energy periods and significant wave heights are compared for the three situations studied. While practical implementation presents engineering challenges, in terms of time-averaged absorbed power, unconstrained near-optimal control is found to perform significantly better than single-frequency tuning in the spectra with longer energy periods ({\textgreater}10 s for the present device), and somewhat better in the spectra with shorter energy periods (here {\^{a}}{\textperthousand}{\textcurrency}10 s).},

	abstract = {Time-domain models are necessary for the analysis of wave energy conversion systems, due to the presence of nonlinearities which may not be neglected for accurate prediction of their performance and behaviour. Such nonlinearities are contributed in varying degrees by drag, Coulomb friction, fluid compressibility, and also control mechanism. In time-domain, the equations of motion for the system will contain hydrodynamic radiation terms expressed as convolution integrals due to the frequency dependence of the radiation coefficients. The evaluation of the convolution integral is time-consuming and is difficult to carry out by standard adaptive solvers. Hence, various approximations to the convolution integral have been proposed to avoid these problems. The purpose of this study is to systematically assess the quality of some selected time-domain models. Generic models of wave energy conversion systems will be developed, with the possibility of varying the relative importance of the nonlinear terms. The time-domain models are categorised according to the convolution approximation and the numerical integration method used. Selected assessment criteria include computation time as well as the statistics of device motions and converted power. A model is always a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. It is hoped that this study will provide some guidelines in the choice of time-domain models suitable for simulation of wave energy conversion systems.},

	abstract = {When dealing with the estimation of the power
production of Wave Energy Converters (WECs), from either
physical laboratory or numerical models, or measured data from
sea testing of prototype, an accurate representation of the wave
spectra at the target location is important for accurate power
production estimates. This due to the typically highly frequencydependent
response of the WECs. Depending on the location and
other factors, sea spectral shapes may deviate significantly from
standard spectra such as the JONSWAP, often assumed in such
estimations. Here, a method for obtaining representative spectra
for a particular location, based on sea wave measurements, is
described, which allows a more accurate characterisation of the
WEC performance.
The analysis described here has been performed on wave data
from a buoy at the location of DanWEC, approximately 1 nautical
mile north of the Port of Hanstholm in Denmark. Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) is used as a tool for both the analyses
of the variance of the wave spectra, and for dimensionality
reduction, before further analyses to find representative wave
spectra.
In this paper a PCA on approximately five years of 1D wave
spectra records shows that approximately 90\% of the variance
can be explained with only five parameters. Similar spectra are
classified into k sets, with the kmeans algorithm. The mean
spectrum of each group can be used as representative spectra for
physical laboratory testing or numerical modelling. An advantage
of this approach is that no assumption is made about the shape
of the spectra.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that deterministic sea wave prediction ({DSWP)} combined with constrained optimal control can dramatically improve the efficiency of sea wave energy converters ({WECs)}, while maintaining their safe operation. We focus on a point absorber {WEC} employing a hydraulic/electric power take-off system. Maximizing energy take-off while minimizing the risk of damage is formulated as an optimal control problem with a disturbance input (the sea elevation) and with both state and input constraints. This optimal control problem is non-convex, which prevents us from using quadratic programming algorithms for the optimal solution. We demonstrate that the optimum can be achieved by bang{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}bang control. This paves the way to adopt a dynamic programming ({DP)} algorithm to resolve the on-line optimization problem efficiently. Simulation results show that this approach is very effective, yielding at least a two-fold increase in energy output as compared with control schemes which do not exploit {DSWP.} This level of improvement is possible even using relatively low precision {DSWP} over short time horizons. A key finding is that only about 1 second of prediction horizon is required, however, the technical difficulties involved in obtaining good estimates necessitate a {DSWP} system capable of prediction over tens of seconds.},

Industry has proposed many technologies and, based on their working principle, these technologies generally can be categorized into oscillating water columns, point absorbers, overtopping systems, and bottom-hinged systems. In particular, many researchers have focused on modeling the point absorber, which is thought to be the most cost-efficient technology to extract wave energy. To model such devices, several modeling methods have been used such as analytical methods, boundary integral equation methods and {Navier{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}Stokes} equation methods. The first two are generally combined with the use of empirical solution to represent the viscous damping effect, while the last one is directly included in the solution.

	abstract = {Phase control may substantially increase the power absorption in point-absorber wave energy converters. This study deals with validation of dynamic models and latching control algorithms for an oscillating water column ({OWC)} inside a fixed vertical tube of small circular cross-section by small-scale testing. The paper describes experimental and numerical results for the system's dynamics, using simple and practical latching control techniques that do not require the prediction of waves or wave forces, and which will be relevant to any type of point-absorbing devices.
In the experimental set-up, the upper end of the tube was equipped with an outlet duct and a shut-off valve, which could be controlled to give a latching of the inner free surface movement. The pressure drop through the open valve is used as a simplified measure of the energy extraction. The control was realized by using the real-time measurement signals for the inner and outer surface displacement.
A mathematical model of the system was established and applied in numerical simulation. In the case the {OWC's} diameter is much smaller than the wavelength and the wave amplitude much smaller than the draft, the free surface movement inside the tube can be described as an oscillating weightless piston. For this hydrodynamic problem an analytical solution is known. In addition, the mathematical model includes the effects of viscous flow losses, the air compressibility inside the chamber and the pressure drop across the valve. Experimental results were used to calibrate some of the model parameters, and the total model was formulated as a coupled system of six non-linear, first-order differential equations. Time-domain integration was used to simulate the system in order to test the control strategies and compare with experimental results.},

	abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

The aperture of this valve is adjustable and can be used to regulate the pneumatic power exposed to the turbine. Here we develop an algorithm to actively control the relief valve aperture so that the peak pneumatic power of each wave cycle approaches but does not breach the turbine stall threshold, thus providing the maximum pneumatic power possible without the turbine stalling. The relief valve aperture is slow to adjust so the hydrodynamic and pneumatic behaviour is forecasted to allow enough time to achieve the correct aperture before the wave reaches the chamber. The chamber hydrodynamics are forecasted using a neural network that considers hydrodynamic measurements made 60 meters up wave and other operational, environmental and preceding wave, parameters. Turbine stalls were identified approximately by the gradient in turbine vibration and the angular velocity dependent pneumatic power threshold for turbine stall is found empirically. The relationship between the forecasted chamber hydrodynamics, relief valve aperture and the resultant pneumatic behaviour, is also found empirically and this is used to select the relief valve aperture that the control algorithm targets.}}

	abstract = {Abstract The amount of energy that a wave energy converter can extract depends strongly on the control strategy applied to the power take-off system. It is well known that, ideally, the reactive control allows for maximum energy extraction from waves. However, the reactive control is intrinsically noncausal in practice and requires some kind of causal approach to be applied. Moreover, this strategy does not consider physical constraints and this could be a problem because the system could achieve unacceptable dynamic values. These, and other control techniques have focused on the wave energy extraction problem in order to maximize the energy absorbed by the power take-off device without considering the possible losses in intermediate devices. In this sense, a reactive control that considers the linear generator copper losses has been recently proposed to increase the useful power injected into the grid. Among the control techniques that have emerged recently, the model predictive control represents a promising strategy. This approach performs an optimization process on a time prediction horizon incorporating dynamic constraints associated with the physical features of the power take-off system.
This paper proposes a model predictive control technique that considers the copper losses in the control optimization process of point absorbers with direct drive linear generators. This proposal makes the most of reactive control as it considers the copper losses, and it makes the most of the model predictive control, as it considers the system constraints. This means that the useful power transferred from the linear generator to the power converters increases. In this sense, the average power delivered to the grid increases and the implementation viability improves. In this paper, the results of the simulations are compared with those obtained from other control strategies in irregular waves.},

In this paper, we present a relaxation to the modeling assumptions that must be made to apply this theory. Specifically, we propose a technique that uses the principle of Gaussian Closure to accommodate nonlinear \{WEC\} dynamics in the synthesis of the optimal feedback law. The technique is approximate, in the sense that it arrives at a computationally efficient control synthesis technique through a Gaussian approximation of the stationary stochastic response of the system. This approach allows for a wide range of nonlinear dynamical models to be considered, and also accommodates many complex loss mechanisms in the power transmission system. The technique is demonstrated through simulation examples pertaining to a flap-type \{WEC\} with a hydraulic power train.},

	abstract = {In this paper the optimal control law for a single nonlinear point absorber in irregular sea-states is derived, and proven to be a closed-loop controller with feedback from measured displacement, velocity and acceleration of the floater. However, a non-causal integral control component dependent on future velocities appears in the optimal control law, rendering the optimal control law less useful for real time implementation. To circumvent this problem a causal closed-loop controller with the same feedback information is proposed, based on a slight modification of the optimal control law. The basic idea behind the control strategy is to enforce the stationary velocity response of the absorber into phase with the wave excitation force at any time. The controller is optimal under monochromatic wave excitation. It is demonstrated that the devised causal controller, in plane irregular sea states, absorbs almost the same power as the optimal controller.},

This work investigates and compares the kinematics of an alternative extreme wave and the traditional extreme ({\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\oe}new-wave{\^{a}}{\texteuro}?). It was observed that although the alternative wave is not as high as the traditional extreme wave it can produce more severe kinematics and by extension, higher loads on a bottom-fixed marine structure. In the specific case investigated, the alternative wave broke while the traditional extreme wave did not break through-out the simulation. This suggests that height alone is not sufficient to characterize an extreme wave and an alternative extreme can occur which though not being the highest is more severe.},

These models, obtained using system identification with data computed by hydrodynamic codes, find application in offshore training simulators, hardware-in-the-loop simulators for positioning control testing, and also in initial designs of wave-energy conversion devices. Different proposals have appeared in the literature to address the identification problem in both time and frequency domains, and recent work has highlighted the superiority of the frequency-domain methods. This paper summarises practical frequency-domain estimation algorithms that use constraints on model structure and parameters to refine the search of approximating parametric models. Practical issues associated with the identification are discussed, including the influence of radiation model accuracy in force-to-motion models, which are usually the ultimate modelling objective. The illustration examples in the paper are obtained using a freely available {MATLAB} toolbox developed by the authors, which implements the estimation algorithms described.},

	abstract = {The dynamics describing the motion response of a marine structure in waves can be represented within a linear framework by the Cummins Equation. This equation contains a convolution term that represents the component of the radiation forces associated with fluid memory effects. Several methods have been proposed in the literature for the identification of parametric models to approximate and replace this convolution term. This replacement can facilitate the model implementation in simulators and the analysis of motion control designs. Some of the reported identification methods consider the problem in the time domain while other methods consider the problem in the frequency domain. This paper compares the application of these identification methods. The comparison is based not only on the quality of the estimated models, but also on the ease of implementation, ease of use, and the flexibility of the identification method to incorporate prior information related to the model being identified. To illustrate the main points arising from the comparison, a particular example based on the coupled vertical motion of a modern containership vessel is presented.},

Model predictive control (MPC) is generally a promising approach for WECs, since system constraints and actuator limits can be taken into account. Moreover, it provides a framework for defining optimal energy capture and it can benefit from predictions. Due to possible nonlinear effects, such as the mooring forces, an NMPC is proposed in this paper, whose performance is compared to that of a linear MPC. Both controllers are supposed to control a nonlinear point absorber model. Computer simulations show that the proposed NMPC is able to optimize the energy capture while satisfying system limits.},

	abstract = {Wave energy conversion is still in its infancy, and in order for it to become a commercially viable technology, developers, investors and utilities need to estimate a Wave Energy Converter's ({WEC's)} performance for the wave climate of a potential installation site. With the goal of estimating a design's power output when subject to stochastic ocean waves, a time-domain modeling methodology was developed for point absorber {WECs} with arbitrary device geometry. This methodology uses the geometry's unique frequency-domain hydrodynamic response to determine the point absorber's time-domain impulse response functions. By implementing the point absorber's impulse response functions, time-domain equations of motion are defined and the {WEC's} heave displacement and velocity are solved for in a {WEC} Dynamics Model developed in {MATLAB/Simulink.} The modeling methodology is first validated for a single-body point absorber with complex geometry by comparison with experimental data. Then the methodology is applied to a two-body point absorber geometry that is representative of designs currently being pursued. The time-domain point absorber model is extended to include a hydraulic power take-off system model that estimates the wave energy converter's power output when subject to real ocean waves. Finally, results are presented from the combined {WEC} dynamics and hydraulic power take-off system model when subject to time-series wave surface elevation from {NDBC} Umpqua Offshore buoy 46229.},

	abstract = {Fred Olsen is currently testing their latest wave energy converter outside of Falmouth Bay in England, preparing it for commercial exploitation at the Wavehub-project. Previous studies have shown that this device has potential for increased power extraction using reactive control, but so far these investigations have focused on the hydrodynamics of the device and on reducing the peak-to-average power ratio while omitting the effect of the electric power take-off system. This thesis shows the development of the hydrodynamic model of the device as well as a detailed model of the all-electric power take-off system consisting of a permanent magnet synchronous generator, inverter and {DC-link.} Vector control is used to control the permanent magnet synchronous generator, and field weakening control of the generator is applied in order allow over-speed operation. Time domain wave-to-wire simulations are performed to evaluate the power takeoff capabilities of the modelled wave energy converter with different control parameters. When tuned according to approximate complex conjugate control the accumulated average generator losses become large, giving a very low overall system efficiency. Optimal control with respect to electrical output power is found to be with low added mass, and when compared to pure passive loading a 1 \% increase in annual energy production is achieved. The main factor that reduces the effect of reactive control is found to be the minimum 10 {kN} load-force constraint of the device, as this disables full oscillatory control. Example simulations on a device with different force constraint are performed which verifies this characteristic. These results suggests that the Bolt2 has limited potential for increase in power extraction by implementing reactive control. The analysis in this thesis is nevertheless valuable, as it demonstrates how a wave-to-wire model can be used for power take-off investigations, annual energy production estimations and evaluations of different control techniques.},

Uncertainties in the physical description of the system as well as in the input from irregular waves provide challenges to the control algorithm. In this paper we present a hybrid robust-fuzzy logic controller that allows for addressing the uncertainty in the model as well as the short term tuning of the converter. The converter is comprised of a spherical heaving buoy with a fixed reference, which could be the bottom or a body at rest. The proposed robust controller uses the energy from the Power Take Off ({PTO)} as input while the Fuzzy Logic ({FL)} controller portion is used to tune for the short term wave variation. The {FL} controller action is based on a prediction of the future incoming irregular wave. Simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid control yields improved energy production, while being robust to modeling errors.},

	abstract = {Abstract A feedback control is proposed in this paper for the control of wave energy converters. The proposed controller is a time-domain approximation for the complex conjugate control in the sense that it is an approach to an optimal solution through impedance matching. The theoretical underpinnings of complex conjugate control are fundamentally linear, and the proposed control exploits the linear control theory to provide a complex conjugate control in the time domain. The proposed control does not need wave prediction or wave measurements. The proposed control is novel in that it is a feedback strategy that has a multi-resonant generator. It targets both amplitude and phase through feedback that is constructed from individual frequency components that come from the spectral decomposition of the measurements signal. Each individual frequency uses a Proportional-Derivative control to provide both optimal resistive and reactive elements. By resonating each frequency component and summing them together the controller feedback effort that maximizes the amount of absorbed power is provided.},

	abstract = {Many studies have been published concerning the influence of the immersed shape (in still water) of a floating body on its response and power capture from ocean waves. With a few notable exceptions, much of this analysis has assumed small amplitude motion and linear models have been employed to predict response. The form of the upper surface of such a body has received little attention. Here, we show how the shape of the upper (top) surface of a floating body can be designed to ensure that the response amplitude of the body is within a specified value. This is of considerable importance to the survivability of wave energy devices. The approach used is to achieve a large increase of both natural period and hydrodynamic damping for only a small change of float mass. These two factors impose a hydrodynamic limit on the displacement which may be exploited to avoid the {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textasciitilde}end-stop{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} problem often encountered in wave device design. To demonstrate the change of response, experimental measurements are presented of the response of an axisymmetric float with rounded base and conical upper surface with rounded perimeter due to a range of regular, irregular and focused wave conditions. Power extraction is not considered since the mechanically undamped response represents the worst case. In contrast to a simple, straight-sided axisymmetric float, a smaller change of mass is required to satisfy a particular response amplitude limit. Although a significant reduction is not expected, hydrodynamic damping may reduce with increasing physical scale, and this remains to be quantified.},

	abstract = {Time-domain models of marine structures based on frequency domain data are usually built upon the Cummins equation. This type of model is a vector integro-differential equation which involves convolution terms. These convolution terms are not convenient for analysis and design of motion control systems. In addition, these models are not efficient with respect to simulation time, and ease of implementation in standard simulation packages. For these reasons, different methods have been proposed in the literature as approximate alternative representations of the convolutions. Because the convolution is a linear operation, different approaches can be followed to obtain an approximately equivalent linear system in the form of either transfer function or state-space models. This process involves the use of system identification, and several options are available depending on how the identification problem is posed. This raises the question whether one method is better than the others. This paper therefore has three objectives. The first objective is to revisit some of the methods for replacing the convolutions, which have been reported in different areas of analysis of marine systems: hydrodynamics, wave energy conversion, and motion control systems. The second objective is to compare the different methods in terms of complexity and performance. For this purpose, a model for the response in the vertical plane of a modern containership is considered. The third objective is to describe the implementation of the resulting model in the standard simulation environment {Matlab/Simulink.}},

	abstract = {The choice of the most suitable control strategy for Wave Energy Converters ({WECs)} is often evaluated with reference to the sinusoidal assumption for incident waves. Under this hypothesis, linear techniques for the control of the extracted power, as passive loading and optimum control are well-known and widely analyzed. It can be shown, however, how their performances are fundamentally different when irregular waves are considered and the theoretical superiority of optimum control is questionable under real wave conditions. Moreover, the global optimization of {WECs} requires a rational design of the power electronics equipment. This requires the analysis of the instantaneous extracted power in addition to the average one. In this paper the impact of irregular waves on the power extraction when using different control techniques is analyzed in the case of a point absorber in heave. It is also shown how a convenient trade-off between high average power extraction and limited power electronics overrating can be obtained by applying simple power saturation techniques. Moreover, the impact of power conversion efficiency on the control strategy is analyzed.},

These motions have been of great concern to the navies and other organizations engaged in shipping for decades and need to be dealt with through the use of a control system. In this work, a new general purpose state-space control-oriented time domain model for the ship motions is introduced. A discrete auto-regressive state-space model is developed using the state-of-the-art linear seakeeping simulation method {SWAN.} Novel features of this state-space model are its ability to capture all free-surface memory effects present in the seakeeping problem, its coupling with the theoretical framework of Linear Quadratic ({LQ)} controllers and its efficient implementation.},

Examples are the devices under development at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, and Oregon State University, {USA}, prototypes of which were recently tested. These devices are equipped with a linear electrical generator. The mooring system consists of a cable that is kept tight by a spring or equivalent device. This cable also prevents the buoy from drifting away by providing a horizontal restoring force.
The horizontal and (to a lesser extent) the vertical restoring forces are nonlinear functions of the horizontal and vertical displacements of the buoy, which makes the system a nonlinear one (even if the spring and damper are linear), whose modelling requires a time-domain analysis. Such an analysis is presented, preceded, for comparison purposes, by a simpler frequency-domain approach. Numerical results (motions and absorbed power) are shown for a system consisting of a hemispherical buoy in regular and irregular waves and a tight mooring cable. The power take-off is modelled by a simplified system of a linear spring and a linear damper and also by a system formed by a hydraulic piston and spring. Different scenarios are analysed.},

Its steady, even if not dashing, development, both in theoretical and applied solutions, will bring the field, in the mid-term, to the point of being a viable, economical and sustainable technology, competitive when compared to more mature ones. This paper deals with the \{ISWEC\} (Inertial Sea Wave Energy Converter) power take off (PTO) technology and control strategies. In particular it focuses on the control strategy used for harnessing energy during its first deployment, and presents the development of a new controller designed using optimal control theory. The approach to the problem of this work is not to seek for the theoretical optimal control strategy. In fact, during the test period of the \{ISWEC\} into the sea, limitations of a model-optimized control strategy came out, due to well known shortcomings of hydrodynamics modeling theory for wave energy devices, and the idea of an easy-to-tune in the field controller arose. This work points out in the direction of developing a practical and effective strategy for industrial application, with the main objective of increasing the power production while simplifying the control law by which the device harnesses energy.},

Measurement and observation of complex hydrodynamic mechanisms are also required to inform the development of modelling tools suitable for the simulation of response to extreme waves. Experimental measurements are reported of the motion of an axisymmetric float to regular and near-focused waves. The mechanical system, incident wave conditions and response in a {2D} vertical plane are detailed to facilitate comparison to numerical simulations. The system comprises a heaving float connected to a counterweight by an inextensible cable over two pulleys to provide a simplified representation of the slowly varying surge constraint of a mooring system. Translation of the float is measured using an optical encoder. Motion in heave, surge and pitch are also determined by a position identification method based on analysis of video footage. For low frequency regular waves, the float prescribes an elliptical trajectory and the variation of response amplitude with wave amplitude is linear. At higher frequencies, drift of up to one-third of the float radius is observed and the float oscillates along an arc. More complex motions are observed due to the three large amplitude waves of a near-focused wave group. During these waves the upper surfaces of the float are partly immersed and motion occurs in heave, surge and pitch.},

	abstract = {Many studies have been published concerning numerical predictions of wave energy device and array responses in both idealised and realistic wave-fields. However, there are few comparisons of predicted array response to experimental measurements, particularly for irregular waves. Although time domain models are widely used for modelling the behaviour of isolated devices, the response of arrays has typically been predicted by assuming linear superposition of steady-state response to regular waves. In this experimental study, the validity of approaches based on linear theory is investigated for an isolated device and array of two devices at 4-and 3-radius centre-to-centre spacing. A range of regular wave frequencies over which response is linear with wave height is identified and these response measurements are used to predict time-varying response to an irregular wave. In irregular waves, the influence of previous wave cycles, the time required for the device to reach a steady response state and the short-term characteristics of the wave-field affect device response.},

However, most potential flow models cannot deal with extreme free surface problems including wave breaking or splashing over the structure. Further, physical experiments easily become very complex and scaling issues arise. In these cases, an approach that includes the viscous effects models both water and air and fully couples the wave and structure is needed. This paper deals with the generation of waves close to the breaking point using two commercial software packages. These may be used to generate an extreme design wave to investigate the survivability of offshore wave energy converters or other devices operating in such a challenging environment.

	year = {2009},
	abstract = {Many different types of wave energy converters have been proposed in recent years. The two primary design considerations are the need to generate energy at competitive economic rates in average sea states and the need for the wave energy converters ({WEC)} to survive extreme wave conditions. Due to the complexity of most offshore wave energy devices and their motion response in different sea states, model scale tank tests are common practice for {WEC} design. Full scale tests are also necessary, but are expensive and only considered once the design has been optimised. Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD)} is now recognised as an important complement to traditional physical testing techniques in offshore engineering. Once properly calibrated and validated to the problem, {CFD} offers a high density of test data and results in a reasonable timescale to assist with design changes and improvements to the device. This paper deals with the results of test cases leading towards simulation of the full dynamics of Pelamis and the Manchester Bobber. The test cases presented involve the interaction between waves and fixed horizontal cylinders and results are compared with experimental data to validate the {CFD} codes. Also results for fluid-structure interaction of an oscillating cone on the water surface are presented. The surface elevation and diffraction effects are discussed, as well as the forces on the structures due to the waves and motion respectively. Four different {CFD} codes are applied to simulate the test cases: Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics, a Cartesian Cut Cell method based on an artificial compressibility method with shock capturing for the interface, and two pressure-based Navier- Stokes codes, one using a Finite Volume and the other a control volume based Finite Element approach.},

	abstract = {Sustainable and efficient design solutions are the aim for any engineer. In offshore engineering forces resulting from extreme wave impact are of special interest as these challenge the structure and the crew working in this harsh environment. Theoretical models tend to be limited to linear or weakly non-linear situations and are unable to predict the violent and turbulent effects of breaking waves in combination with wave run up on structures or green water loading. The classic approach for such cases is to carry out scale model tests in a physical wave tank and measure the forces, water levels and flow velocities at some chosen locations. Another approach is to use fully non-linear calculations, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, which have the potential to investigate the design in different conditions at full scale. This paper deals with the generation and behaviour of extreme focused wave groups in a numerical wave tank. Non-linear effects of these extreme waves are shown and the implications for a numerical wave tank are discussed. Also the forces on horizontal and vertical cylinders, which represent simple models of offshore structures, are calculated. All numerical results are compared with measured data from physical experiments.},

Both `partially nonlinear' and fully nonlinear potential flow methods, as well as computational fluid dynamics methods solving the Navier--Stokes equations and smoothed particle hydrodynamics have been used for this purpose and are reviewed here. These more complex methods have been applied primarily to single devices, so array and mooring line interactions are not considered. While a number of studies have been performed in these areas and results are encouraging, further advances are required to give accurate prediction or reproduction of experimental results.},

The tuning issue is addressed by employing both fixed (passive) and adaptive (active) power-take-off settings. The fixed power-take-off tuning approach includes models based on tuning the device natural frequency to either the energy frequency or peak frequency of the sea-state or a weighted average of several peak frequencies. The adaptive tuning approaches employ a sliding discrete Fourier transform frequency analysis, or a time-series analysis of the measured wave elevation and device velocity to estimate a localized dominant wave frequency and hence calculate power-take-off settings. The paper presents details of these tuning techniques by discussing issues related to the modelling, simulation, and predicted power captures for each method. A comparative study of each method along with practical implications of the results and recommendations are also presented.},

This scheme is integrated into a time-domain simulation tool, with fully coupled hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from the hydrodynamic software - {WAMIT} which solves the Boundary Value Problem ({BVP).} The equations of motion are transformed into standard state-space format, using the constant coefficient approximation and the impulse response function method. Thus the Ordinary Differential Equation ({ODE)} solvers in {MATLAB} can be directly employed. The time-domain responses of a single spar at sea are initially obtained. The optimal Linear Quadratic Regulator ({LQR)} controller is further applied to this single spar, by assuming that the Dynamic Positioning ({DP)} system can provide the optimized thruster forces. Various factors that affect the controlling efficiency, e.g., the time steps {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\dag}{\"{I}}{\quotedblbase} and {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\dag}t, the weighting factors({Q,R)}, are further investigated in detail. Next, a two-body floating system is studied. The response amplitude operators ({RAOs)} of each body are calculated and compared with the single body case. Then the effects of the body-to-body interaction coefficients on the time-domain responses are further investigated. Moreover, the mean drift force is incorporated in the {DP} system to further mitigate the motion responses of each body. Finally, this tool is extended to a three-body floating system, with the relative motions between them derived.},

	abstract = {A time domain model is applied to a three-dimensional point absorber wave energy converter. The dynamical properties of a semi-submerged hemisphere oscillating around a pivot point where the vertical height of this point is above the mean water level are investigated. The numerical model includes the calculation of the non-linear hydrostatic restoring moment by a cubic polynomial function fit to laboratory test results. Moreover, moments due to viscous drag are evaluated on the oscillating hemisphere considering the horizontal and vertical drag force components. The influence on the motions of this non-linear effect is investigated by a simplified formulation proportional to the quadratic velocity. Results from experiments are shown in order to validate the numerical calculations. All the experimental results are in good agreement with the linear potential theory as long as the waves are sufficiently mild i.e. {H/{\^{I}}{\guillemotright}{\^{a}}{\textperthousand}{\textcurrency}0.02H/{\^{I}}{\guillemotright}{\^{a}}{\textperthousand}{\textcurrency}0.02.} For steep waves, {H/{\^{I}}{\guillemotright}{\^{a}}{\textperthousand}{\textyen}0.04H/{\^{I}}{\guillemotright}{\^{a}}{\textperthousand}{\textyen}0.04} however, the relative velocities between the body and the waves increase thus requiring inclusion of the non-linear hydrostatic restoring moment to effectively predict the dynamics of the wave energy converter. For operation of the device with a passively damping power take-off the moment due to viscous drag is found to be negligible.},

	abstract = {Currently, a number of wave energy converters are being analyzed by means of numerical models in order to predict the electrical power generation under given wave conditions. A common characteristic of this procedure is to integrate the loadings from the hydrodynamics, power take-off and mooring systems into a central wave to wire model. The power production then depends on the control strategy which is applied to the device. The objective of this paper is to develop numerical methods for motion analysis of marine structures with a special emphasis on wave energy converters. Two different time domain models are applied to a point absorber system working in pitch mode only. The device is similar to the well-known Wavestar prototype located in the Danish North Sea. A laboratory model has been set up in order to validate the numerical simulations of the dynamics. Wave Excitation force and the response of the device for regular and irregular waves were measured. Good correspondence is found between the numerical and the physical model for relatively mild wave conditions. For higher waves the numerical model seems to underestimate the response of the device due to its linear fluid-structure interaction assumption and linearized equation of motion. The region over which the numerical model is valid will be presented in terms of non-dimensional parameters describing the different wave states.},

In a synchronous data collection system, the statistically independent data blocks can be processed in parallel or sequentially, or similar data can be compressed before processing; in the linear case these three filter types are optimum and their results are identical. When measurements from each sensor are statistically independent, the data compression method is shown to be computationally most efficient, followed by the sequential processing; the parallel processing is least efficient.},

	abstract = {By the modern time series analysis method, based on the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) innovation model, a unified and general information fusion steady-state Kalman filtering approach is presented for the general multisensor systems with different local dynamic models and correlated noises. It can handle the filtering, smoothing, and prediction fusion problems for state or signal. The optimal fusion rule weighted by matrices is re-derived as a weighted least squares (WLS) fuser, and is reviewed. An optimal fusion rule weighted by diagonal matrices is presented, which is equivalent to the optimal fusion rule weighted by scalars for components, and it realizes a decoupled fusion. The new algorithms of the steady-state Kalman estimator gains are presented. In order to compute the optimal weights, the formulas of computing the cross-covariances among local estimation errors by Lyapunov equations are presented. The exponential convergence of the iterative solution of Lyapunov equation is proved. It is proved that the optimal fusion estimators under three weighted fusion rules are locally optimal, but are globally suboptimal. The proposed steady-state Kalman fusers can reduce the on-line computational burden, and are suitable for real-time applications. A simulation example for the 3-sensor steady-state Kalman tracking fusion estimators shows their effectiveness and correctness, and gives the accuracy comparison of the fusion rules.},

The first fusion layer has a netted parallel structure to determine the cross covariance between every pair of faultless sensors at each time step. The second fusion layer is the fusion center that determines the optimal fusion matrix weights and obtains the optimal fusion filter. Comparing it with the centralized filter, the result shows that the computational burden is reduced, and the precision of the fusion filter is lower than that of the centralized filter when all sensors are faultless, but the fusion filter has fault tolerance and robustness properties when some sensors are faulty. Further, the precision of the fusion filter is higher than that of each local filter. Applying it to a radar tracking system with three sensors demonstrates its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new approach of heterogeneous data source fusion. Data sources are either static or active: static data sources can be structured or semi-structured, whereas active sources are services. In order to develop data sources fusion systems in dynamic contexts, we need to study all issues raised by the matching paradigms. This challenging problem becomes crucial with the dominating role of the internet. Classical approaches of data integration, based on schemas mediation, are not suitable to the World Wide Web (WWW) environment where data is frequently modified or deleted. Therefore, we develop a loosely integrated approach that takes into consideration both conflict management and semantic rules which must be enriched in order to integrate new data sources. Moreover, we introduce an XML-based Multi-data source Fusion Language (MFL) that aims to define and retrieve conflicting data from multiple data sources. The system, which is developed according to this approach, is called \{MDSManager\} (Multi-Data Source Manager). The benefit of the proposed framework is shown through a real world application based on web data sources fusion which is dedicated to online markets indices tracking. Finally, we give an evaluation of our \{MFL\} language. The results show that our language improves significantly the \{XQuery\} language especially considering its expressiveness power and its performances.},

Empirically based models are used in structural, mechanical and control design processes, as well as for performance prediction. Both the design of experiments and methods used in system identification have a strong impact on the quality of the resulting model. This study considers the system identification and model validation process based on data collected from a wave tank test of a model-scale wave energy converter. Experimental design and data processing techniques based on general system identification procedures are discussed and compared with the practices often followed for wave tank testing. The general system identification processes are shown to have a number of advantages, including an increased signal-to-noise ratio, reduced experimental time and higher frequency resolution. The experimental wave tank data is used to produce multiple models using different formulations to represent the dynamics of the wave energy converter. These models are validated and their performance is compared against one another. While most models of wave energy converters use a formulation with surface elevation as an input, this study shows that a model using a hull pressure measurement to incorporate the wave excitation phenomenon has better accuracy.},

	abstract = {Wave-energy converters (WECs) need a reaction source against which the wave forces can react. As with shore-based WECs, sometimes also floating WECs react against a fixed point on the seabed. Alternatively, for a floating WEC, force reaction may be obtained by utilizing the relative motion between two bodies. A load force for energy conversion is assumed to be applied only to this relative motion. It is assumed that either body oscillates in one mode only (mostly, the heave mode is considered here). The system, if assumed to be linear, is proved to be phenomenologically equivalent to a one-mode, one-body system, for which the wave excitation force equals the force which is necessary to apply between the two bodies in order to ensure that they are oscillating with zero relative motion. It is discussed how this equivalent excitation force and also the intrinsic mechanical impedance of the equivalent system depend on the mechanical impedances for the two separate bodies, including the radiation impedance matrix (which combines radiation resistances and added masses). The equivalent system is applied for discussing optimum performance for maximizing the absorbed wave energy. It is shown that, for an axisymmetric system utilizing heave modes, it is possible to absorb an energy amounting to the incident wave power on a crest length which equals the wavelength divided by 2π, even though the power take-off is applied to the relative motion only. Moreover, it is shown that it is possible to obtain an equivalent excitation force which exceeds the wave excitation force on either body.},

The costs accompanied by testing a wave energy converter and its \{PTO\} at sea are high due to the difficult accessibility of (remote) test locations. Next to easy accessibility, the lab setup provides controllable waves at a relatively lower cost. The setup enables extensive analysis of the dynamics of a \{PTO\} during its mechanical towards electrical energy conversion. The scaled setup is designed such that it resembles as close as possible the real system. Froudes similarity law provides easy transformation. The floater and waves are represented by a Wave Emulator, the motion of which is determined by a time series of the wave exciting forces supplemented with the actual hydrodynamic reaction forces due to the motions of the floater. A real-time calculation method is introduced, accounting for the actual \{PTO\} actions. Furthermore, the inertia of the floater is represented in the emulators rotary inertia, and a compensation method is proposed enabling an identical normalized \{PTO\} load curve as at full scale. Comparison between experimental and simulation results have been performed and good correlation between the movement of setup and simulations has been found.},

In this work a point absorber wave energy converter operating in heave mode separately, coupled to a Linear Permanent Magnet Generator (LPMG); where the results are obtained in simulation. The \{PTO\} force is controlled by a machine side back-to-back voltage source converter (VSC), which is connected to a constant DC-link voltage. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is then used to maximise the absorbed electrical power with the resistive losses of the \{PTO\} included; this is compared with classical control methods. The optimal force produced from the \{MPC\} incorporates legitimate physical and electrical constraints of the \{WEC\} and \{LPMG\} -the importance of including such constraints within the optimisation is shown. Field weakening and a uni-directional power flow constraint are then incorporated to help prevent poor grid power quality when fluctuations in the DC-link occur. It is assumed that the constrained optimal control approach produces the highest possible electrical power available. This means that it is now possible to clearly see the effect of physical design choices on the performance on a level playing field.},

This paper considers the parametric estimation of these impending waves by employing a network of spatially distributed ocean sensors, possibly of different types, whose measurements are noisy. We provide general expressions for the Fisher information matrix and the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) under white Gaussian noise. The CRB is a lower bound on the smallest mean-square estimation error, which is nearly achievable for a sufficient number of observations. The expressions are general in the sense that the sensor network could be made up of a single or multiple types of sensors. We present a low-complexity estimation method that employs linear optimizations coupled with periodograms and phase unwrapping. Numerical results demonstrating the accuracy of the presented estimation method relative to the CRB are provided.},

	abstract = {A single low cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) is often used in conjunction with GPS to increase the accuracy and improve the availability of the navigation solution for a pedestrian navigation system. This paper develops several fusion algorithms for using multiple IMUs to enhance performance. In particular, this research seeks to understand the benefits and detriments of each fusion method in the context of pedestrian navigation. Three fusion methods are proposed. First, all raw IMU measurements are mapped onto a common frame (i.e., a virtual frame) and processed in a typical combined GPS-IMU Kalman filter. Second, a large stacked filter is constructed of several IMUs. This filter construction allows for relative information between the IMUs to be used as updates. Third, a federated filter is used to process each IMU as a local filter. The output of each local filter is shared with a master filter, which in turn, shares information back with the local filters. The construction of each filter is discussed and improvements are made to the virtual IMU (VIMU) architecture, which is the most commonly used architecture in the literature. Since accuracy and availability are the most important characteristics of a pedestrian navigation system, the analysis of each filter's performance focuses on these two parameters. Data was collected in two environments, one where GPS signals are moderately attenuated and another where signals are severely attenuated. Accuracy is shown as a function of architecture and the number of IMUs used.},

The wave period and height are crucial information to maximize the power output from the AWS. However, since the AWS is installed on the seabed, additional sensors and buoys are required to obtain the ocean wave information. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to obtain the states of the ocean wave by measuring the generator current in the α - β domain. As the EKF requires the Jacobian matrix of the system dynamic equations for the system matrix, simplified hydrodynamics of the floater including the Froude-Krylov excitation force and the domain α - β voltage equation of the generator is derived to develop the mathematical model of the AWS. In order to verify the performance of the estimator, a numerical simulation is performed and presented and it shows great agreement with the actual motion.},

Much of the research effort has gone into developing time domain state space models of point absorber wave energy converters (WECs) and subsequently into model-based optimal control to efficiently harvest the maximum possible amount of energy. The resulting controllers require knowledge of the states of the WEC in order to achieve the design goals.

A 1/50th scale buoy system has been constructed at the University of Hull for modelling, verification and control. This study focuses on the time-varying state space model development of this direct-drive WEC with a tubular permanent magnet linear generator (TPMLG). A new form of control is developed, with (i) an adaptive impedance tuning system based on a mechanical-electrical analogue, and (ii) position and current tracking for power maximisation, physical constraint realisation and generator dynamic linearisation. Simulation results of regular and irregular waves indicate this control strategy can achieve an acceptable energy conversion efficiency.},

The first estimates the target acceleration using the measured velocity, and the second, which is proposed for the first time in this paper, estimates acceleration using the measured position. To quantify the performance of these PVM $\alpha$- $\beta$- $\gamma$ filters, we analytically derive steady-state errors that assume that the target is moving with constant acceleration or jerk. With these performance indices, the optimal gains of the PVM $\alpha$- $\beta$- $\gamma$ filters are determined using a minimum-variance filter criterion. The performance of each filter under these optimal gains is then analyzed and compared. Numerical analyses clarify the performance of the PVM $\alpha$- $\beta$- $\gamma$ filters and verify that their accuracy is better than that of the general position-only-measured $\alpha$- $\beta$- $\gamma$ filter, even when the variance in velocity measurement noise is comparatively large. We identify the conditions under which the proposed PVM $\alpha$- $\beta$- $\gamma$ filter outperforms the general $\alpha$- $\beta$- $\gamma$ filter for different ratios of noise variance in the velocity and position measurements. Finally, numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the PVM $\alpha$- $\beta$- $\gamma$ filters for a realistic maneuvering target.},

Both constrained and unconstrained optimal control problems are presented. Both periodic and non-periodic excitation forces are considered. In contrast to prior work, it is shown that for this non-autonomous system, the optimal control, in general, includes both singular arc and bang-bang modes. Conditions that determine the switching times to/from the singular arc are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal control solution matches the solution obtained using the complex conjugate control. A generic linear dynamic model is used in the simulations. The main advantage of the proposed control is that it finds the optimal control without the need for wave prediction; it only requires the knowledge of the excitation force and its derivatives at the current time.},

However, in contrast with several linear control techniques, closed-loop frequency-domain properties such as sensitivities and robustness to small perturbations are usually not taken into account in the MPC design. This technical note considers the problem of tuning an MPC controller that behaves as a given linear controller when the constraints are not active (e.g., for perturbations around the equilibrium that remain within the given input and state bounds), therefore inheriting the small-signal properties of the linear control design, and that still optimally deals with constraints during transients. We provide two methods for selecting the MPC weight matrices so that the resulting MPC controller behaves as the given linear controller, therefore solving the posed inverse problem of controller matching, and is globally asymptotically stable.},

	volume = {51},
	year = {2015},
	abstract = {In recent years, many advanced control strategies have been proposed for wave energy converters (WECs), which significantly increase the energy conversion rate of the devices. So far, most of these control schemes have only been investigated theoretically using simulations, which, to a great extent, are based on idealized assumptions. On the contrast, far less information regarding the testing of these control schemes in experimental setups can be found. Under such circumstances, the control performance might be compromised by many factors such as model uncertainties, measurement noise, or delay. This paper compares the performance of a spring damper control and an advanced control strategy for a point absorber WEC in wave tank experiments. For two different irregular sea states, the energy conversion of the advanced control, which uses an observer to estimate the wave excitation force, is compared to the performance of a spring damper control. The results show that, with the advanced controller around 13%-14%, more energy could be converted when compared to the spring damper control. Additionally, the observing process was found to be critical in the advanced control. The conducted experiments show that an increase in the observer accuracy holds a theoretical potential to further improve the energy conversion rate by 15%-25%.},

Unlike the few other examples of WEC array experimental campaigns, the power take-off (PTO) system of each WEC was simulated by means of advanced equipment capable of accurately reproducing linear control strategies and, thereby, reducing the uncertainty in the physical model. Experimental measurements are then compared with numerical predictions showing reasonable agreement; the measured trends are, in the same way, well captured by the numerical predictions. Further analysis demonstrates that the developed tool can predict, on the safe side, wave forces and power absorption with less than 17.5% and 23.0% error, respectively, for more than 68% of the predictions.},

	title = {Design and Control of the PowerTake-Off System for a Wave Energy Converter with Multiple Absorbers},
	year = {2013},
	abstract = {Most active Wave Energy Converter (WEC) concepts are based on harvesting energy from ocean waves by placing buoyant bodies in the sea. As the bodies are forced to oscillate by the waves, power is produced by converting the oscillations into electricity, which is performed by the Power Take-Off (PTO).Despite 40 years of research activities within wave energy, the PTO is still a hindrance. No matured designs exist and no installed prototypes have demonstrated average electrical production above 250kW. Looking beyond 1MW, limited research exists, making the lack of advances in PTO research a contributing factor to wave energy remaining in a pre-commercialisation phase - a phase where electrical power production has been demonstrated, but needs to find a road to larger power scales and effective production.The purpose of the research documented in this dissertation is to find a PTO capable of meeting current and future needs of WECs, i.e. meeting requirements of efficiency, controllability and durability while having the important feature of scalability. The case study for the research is the Wavestar 600kW 20 float multiple absorber, but the research has general applicability to WECs based on converting bi-directional motions into electricity.All PTO technologies are kept open and based on a thorough analysis and evaluation of state-of-the-art, the PTO technologies with greatest potential are identified. The state-of-the-art covers both PTOs for wave energy, but also general advances in high powertransmissions, which have applicability to wave energy.One of the difficulties in PTO design is performing the trade-off between contradicting PTO characteristics, e.g. controllability, efficiency and peak power capacity. A PTO system for wave energy is a classic example of a mechatronic design problem, where all aspects of the design couples. To this end a framework is presented where all classic wave power extraction methods (reactive control, linear damping, latching control, declutching, etc.) are analysed according to a generic PTO formulation and optimised using numerical simulations in irregular waves. This enables a comparison of the performance of the wave power extraction methods according to PTO requirements. The framework also allows comparing performance of fundamentally different PTOs.The idea of reactive control for increasing power absorption dates back to the 1970's, and today its feasibility for real PTO systems still causes dispute. In this dissertation an analytical result is provided, proving that reactive control is highly beneficial at even ``low'' PTO efficiencies.The formulated reactive control is tested in a wave tank with 1:20 scale absorbers, validating the expected performance. The wave tank tests also verify the derived wave and absorber models, which are based on linear wave theory. This increases the confidence in the heavy use of models through-out the work.A new high performing control method is developed for wave power extraction characterised in that the Oscillation Control is Implemented Resistively (OCIR). The OCIR control implements a causal non-linear control, which achieve similar manipulation of the absorber's behaviour as reactive control, but through non-linear damping techniques. The control is shown to be superior to other resistive control techniques.The research leads to three potential PTO systems, where one is a magnetic gear based PTO. The gear is based on implementing the function of a screw and nut magnetically by placing permanent magnets in a helical pattern. A PTO layout with the magnetic lead screw is found and analysed using simulations. The feasibility leads to having a group of master students designing a working prototype at a scale of 17kN with a half meter stroke. The magnetic lead screw is able to directly convert a linear motion of 0.5m/s to a rotational motion above 1000rpm, driving a conventional generator.Two other hydraulic PTO solutions are also found highly feasible. One of them is based on discrete control of a hydraulic cylinder, and is assessed to be the most promising solution. It is therefore analysed in depth. The solution is named a Discrete Displacement Cylinder (DDC). The developed DDC allows discrete force control of a multi-chambered cylinder driven by the absorber, while efficiently transferring the generated power directly into a battery of high pressure accumulators. The concept allows DDCs of multiple absorbers to supply the same accumulator battery, where a hydraulic motor may use the stored energy to drive a generator at near constant load.A complete PTO with the DDC is designed and simulated for a 20 absorber Wavestar 600kW WEC. The simulation comprises a 20 absorber hydrodynamic model, all PTO component models, and all main system control. The plus 600 state simulation model proves the expected PTO performance.A working full scale 420kN prototype of the DDC for one absorber is designed and tested. The DDC consists of a multi-chambered cylinder with 2m stroke and a prototype valve manifold. The manifold is implemented using high performance proportional valves instead of on/off valves. This allows emulating an arbitrary on/off valve. The prototype DDC has a peak power capacity of 210kW. To test the DDC prototype, commissioning of a full-scale test-bench was necessary. The test-bench uses a second hydraulic cylinder to emulate the movement of an absorber in waves. A control solution based on state-space control is developed, which tracks a real-time implemented simulation model of the absorber. This enables the test-bench to emulate the absorber dynamics while suppressing its natural modes. The test-bench is shown to emulate theabsorber dynamics, including being able to respond correctly to PTO loads.Systematic tests are performed on the prototype DDC, validating the calculated requirements of valves etc. Anticipated problems with line dynamics are experienced, where the impact pressure during shifting gives a 30% extra pressure peak. The measured responses could be simulated exactly, and by using the models, an improved shifting technique is developed solving the problem.Finally, an initial test of the prototype DDC in irregular waves is successfully performed on the test-bench, verifying the applied models and approaches.}}

	abstract = {Most research on system identification is focused on the identification of parametric models, for example a transfer function or a state space model where the information is condensed in a few parameters. In the daily practice, nonparametric methods, like frequency response function measurements, are intensively used. Recently, it was indicated that nonparametric identification methods could be used to robustify the parametric identification framework. A nonparametric preprocessing step can also be used to reduce or even eliminate the required user interaction, making system identification accessible for a much wider user group. For that reason, there is an increasing interest in nonparametric identification. In order to choose, compare, and to benchmark these nonparametric methods, it is very important to select the proper criteria. In this paper we identify and discuss the important choices that should be considered. It will be shown that these strongly depend on the intended use of the nonparametric model..},

It is shown that an extended model makes it possible to start from frequency response functions (FRFs) without suffering from leakage, by modelling the initial conditions of each data block used in the averaging procedure of the H 1 estimator. In this way the measurements can be averaged in order to reduce both the data set and the noise levels without introducing bias errors caused by leakage phenomena. It is shown by both simulations and real-life measurements that the presented approach improves the modal parameter estimates and in particular the damping estimates.},

The algorithm supports a multivariable frequency-dependent weighting, which generally improves the quality of the transfer function model estimate.

	abstract = {The energy cost for producing electricity via wave energy converters (WECs) is still not competitive with other renewable energy sources, especially wind energy. It is well known that energy maximising control plays an important role to improve the performance of WECs, allowing the energy conversion to be performed as economically as possible. The control strategies are usually subsequently employed on a device that was designed and optimized in the absence of control for the prevailing sea conditions in a particular location. If an optimal unconstrained control strategy, such as pseudo-spectral optimal control (PSOC), is adopted, an overall optimized system can be obtained no matter whether the control design is incorporated at the geometry optimization stage or not. Nonetheless, strategies, such as latching control (LC), must be incorporated at the optimization design stage of the WEC geometry if an overall optimized system is to be realised. In this paper, the impact of device motion and force constraints in the design of control-informed optimized WEC geometries is addressed. The aim is to verify to what extent the constraints modify the connection between the control and the optimal device design. Intuitively, one might expect that if the constraints are very tight, the optimal device shape is the same regardless of incorporating or not the constrained control at the geometry optimization stage. However, this paper tests the hypothesis that the imposition of constraints will limit the control influence on the optimal device shape. PSOC, LC and passive control (PC) are considered in this study. In addition, constrained versions of LC and PC are presented.},

The proposed control strategy finds the optimal control in the sense that it computes the control based on the complex conjugate criteria. This control strategy is relatively easy to implement since it is a feedback control in the time domain that requires only measurements of the buoy motion. Numerical tests are presented for two different buoy shapes: a sphere and a cylinder. Regular, Bretschnieder, and Ochi-Hubble waves are tested. Simulation results show that the proposed controller harvests energy in the pith-surge-heave modes that is about three times the energy that can be harvested using a heave only device.

The key idea is to monitor the movements of the poles and zeros of the linearized models and to reduce the number of candidate models on the basis of these observations. Besides the well known open loop single branch Wiener-, Hammerstein-, and Wiener--Hammerstein systems, we also cover a number of more general structures like parallel (multi branch) Wiener--Hammerstein models, and closed loop block oriented models, including linear fractional representation (LFR) models.},

For this reason, the majority of the networks that were conceived recently for use in these environments provide some means to deal with distributed clock (DC) synchronization. EtherCAT is a high-performance Ethernet-based industrial network. Its main goal is to enable the adoption of Ethernet communications in automation applications that require short cycle times and low communication jitters. This protocol is an open standard based on master-slave architecture. An important feature of EtherCAT is the DC synchronization mechanism, which enables all devices to share the same system time. In this way, typical control operations, such as the generation of coordered output signals or the precise timestamping of input events, can be synchronized for all devices in the network.}}

However, the identification problem of most types of block-oriented nonlinear models can be very difficult (especially the generation of initial estimates) and time-consuming. Therefore it is of crucial importance to select the most appropriate model structure directly from the measurement data, before proceeding with the actual nonlinear identification. In this work, we explore methods to detect the internal structure of the system (in particular, the presence of nonlinear feedback), based on the best linear approximation paradigm. Two different strategies (varying DC (mean value) and standard deviation (STD) of the excitation signal) are compared. The methods are applied on two real systems with a static nonlinear block in the feedback path.},

	abstract = {Abstract Block-oriented models are often used to model nonlinear systems. These models consist of linear dynamic (L) and nonlinear static (N) sub-blocks. This paper addresses the generation of initial estimates for a Wiener--Hammerstein model (LNL cascade). While it is easy to measure the product of the two linear blocks using a Gaussian excitation and linear identification methods, it is difficult to split the global dynamics over the individual blocks. This paper first proposes a well-designed multisine excitation with pairwise coupled random phases. Next, a modified best linear approximation is estimated on a shifted frequency grid. It is shown that this procedure creates a shift of the input dynamics with a known frequency offset, while the output dynamics do not shift. The resulting transfer function, which has complex coefficients due to the frequency shift, is estimated with a modified frequency domain estimation method. The identified poles and zeros can be assigned to either the input or output dynamics. Once this is done, it is shown in the literature that the remaining initialization problem can be solved much easier than the original one. The method is illustrated on experimental data obtained from the Wiener--Hammerstein benchmark system.},

To increase the flexibility of single branch block-oriented models, such as Hammerstein, Wiener, and Wiener--Hammerstein models, parallel block-oriented models can be considered. This paper presents a method to identify parallel Wiener--Hammerstein systems starting from input--output data only. In the first step, the best linear approximation is estimated for different input excitation levels. In the second step, the dynamics are decomposed over a number of parallel orthogonal branches. Next, the dynamics of each branch are partitioned into a linear time invariant subsystem at the input and a linear time invariant subsystem at the output. This is repeated for each branch of the model. The static nonlinear part of the model is also estimated during this step. The consistency of the proposed initialization procedure is proven. The method is validated on real-world measurements using a custom built parallel Wiener--Hammerstein test system.},

It is known that a controller exists if and only if the unique stabilizing solutions to two algebraic Riccati equations are positive definite and the spectral radius of their product is less than γ2. Under these conditions, a parameterization of all controllers solving the problem is given as a linear fractional transformation (LFT) on a contractive, stable, free parameter. The state dimension of the coefficient matrix for the LFT, constructed using the two Riccati solutions, equals that of the plant and has a separation structure reminiscent of classical LQG (i.e. H 2) theory. This paper is intended to be of tutorial value, so a standard H2 solution is developed in parallel},

The recursive simulation of fluctuation in wave height is accomplished by ARMA algorithm based on a two-stage model-fitting approach that provides simulated processes consistent with the prescribed spectral descriptions. The sensitivity of the model order to the wave spectral description is presented. The parametric simulation schemes of linearly related processes, e.g. wave load effects, are conducted by means of discrete convolution models utilizing finite and infinite wave forms. A parametric model representing differentiation in the context of a linear transformation is employed to simulate derivatives of response processes. A hybrid combination of discrete convolution and differentiation models provides an efficient simulation scheme for evaluating wave loads at the instantaneous position of compliant platforms. Interpolation of time histories is carried out utilizing double subscripted digital filters. The selection of appropriate models and their orders is discussed in the context of their stability, accuracy and robustness. Detailed examples are given to illustrate the practical features of these models.},

The pitch-surge modes are usually coupled and are parametrically excited by the heave mode, depending on the buoy geometry. In this paper, a Model Predictive Control is applied to the parametric excited pitch-surge motion, while the heave motion is optimized independently. The optimality conditions are derived, and a gradient-based numerical optimization algorithm is used to search for the optimal control. Numerical tests are conducted for regular and Bretschneider waves. The results demonstrate that the proposed control can be implemented to harvest more than three times the energy that can be harvested using a heave-only wave energy converter. The energy harvested using a parametrically excited model is higher than that is harvested when using a linear model.},

Wave energy converter ({WEC}) tank testing is complex and has its own specificities compared
with model testing of ships and offshore structures. This largely reflects the fact that the main
quantity of interest is wave energy: how much is available and how much is harvested by the
model.
This paper provides an extensive overview of the various aspects of {WEC} tank testing. These are
divided into three categories: physical model, measurements, and wave generation. For each of
them, current best practice guidelines are given.}}

A standard linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) is used to show the negative effects that the unaccounted non-linear viscosity force in the hydrodynamic system has on the power absorption. A non-linear MPC (NLMPC) is then implemented, where the non-linear viscosity effects are included in the optimisation. A linear drag coefficient estimate of the non-linear viscosity is then included in the linear MPC; creating a Linear Viscous Model Predictive Control. When constraints are incorporated, it is shown that a single choice of the linear viscous drag coefficient for use within the linear MPC can provide comparable results to the non-linear MPC approach, over a wide range of sea states.},

	abstract = {AbstractOcean waves are a huge, largely untapped energy resource, and the potential for extracting energy from waves is considerable. Research in this area is driven by the need to meet renewable energy targets, but is relatively immature compared to other renewable energy technologies. This review introduces the general status of wave energy and evaluates the device types that represent current wave energy converter (WEC) technology, particularly focusing on work being undertaken within the United Kingdom. The possible power take-off systems are identified, followed by a consideration of some of the control strategies to enhance the efficiency of point absorber-type WECs. There is a lack of convergence on the best method of extracting energy from the waves and, although previous innovation has generally focused on the concept and design of the primary interface, questions arise concerning how best to optimize the powertrain. This article concludes with some suggestions of future developments.},

	abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) strategies can efficiently deal with constraints on system states, inputs, and outputs. However, in contrast with linear control techniques, closed-loop frequency-domain properties of MPC such as sensitivity and robustness to small perturbations are difficult to enforce a priori. This paper considers the problem of transforming a given linear feedback control design, referred to as ``favorite controller'', into a model predictive control one. In this way, the MPC controller inherits all the stability, robustness and frequency properties of the given favorite controller in the region around the equilibrium where the constraints are not active. The added value is that the constructed MPC controller is able to properly handle constraints that may be activated during the transient, and that global stability in the set of feasible initial conditions can be guaranteed.}}

	abstract = {Abstract For discrete-time linear time invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly, the state feedback control law which minimizes a quadratic performance criterion. We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive for a wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also provides an insight into the structure underlying optimization-based controllers.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to formulate, study, and (in certain cases) resolve the Inverse Problem of Optimal Control Theory, which is the following: Given a control law, find all performance indices for which this control law is optimal. Under the assumptions of (a) linear constant plant, (b) linear constant control law, (c) measurable state variables, (d) quadratic loss functions with constant coefficients, (e) single control variable, we give a complete analysis of this problem and obtain various explicit conditions for the optimality of a given control law. An interesting feature of the analysis is the central role of frequency-domain concepts, which have been ignored in optimal control theory until very recently. The discussion is presented in rigorous mathematical form. The central conclusion is the following (Theorem 6): A stable control law is optimal if and only if the absolute value of the corresponding return difference is at least equal to one at all frequencies. This provides a beautifully simple connecting link between modern control theory and the classical point of view which regards feedback as a means of reducing component variations.},

	abstract = {A moored multi-body line absorber is an attractive option for offshore wave energy conversion. Laboratory studies have been undertaken to determine capture width with multi-mode excitation and heave resonance for the three-float system M4 where the adjacent float spacing is about half a typical wavelength giving anti-phase forcing. The floats increase in diameter and draft from bow to stern and the bow and mid float are rigidly connected by a beam. A hinge with a damper above the mid float absorbs power from the relative rotation between the bow/mid float and the stern float. The resonant heave frequency for each float is different. Anti-phase surge forcing between mid and stern floats is substantial, while there is no hydrostatic stiffness producing resonance. This represents a hydrodynamically complex system and the laboratory experiments indicate high overall capture widths in irregular waves across a range of peak periods without damping optimisation. With different spectral peakedness and directional spread, the capture width is greater than 20 {\%} of a wavelength (based on the energy period) across a range of peak periods typical of an offshore site for floats with a rounded base. The maximum capture width was about 37 {\%} of a wavelength with rounded base floats; having rounded rather than flat bases increased energy capture by up to 60 {\%} by reducing energy losses due to drag. For floats with flat bases comparisons with a geometrically scaled device five times larger and with similar magnitudes of equivalent damping showed similar capture widths as a proportion of wavelength.},

A well chosen, general nonlinear model structure is proposed that is identified in a two-step procedure. First, a best linear approximation is identified using the classical linear identification methods. In the second step, the nonlinear extensions are identified with a linear least-squares method. The proposed model not only includes Wiener and Hammerstein systems, it is also suitable to model nonlinear feedback systems. The stability of the nonlinear model can be easily verified. The method is illustrated on experimental data.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of experiments are being conducted to study the design and performance of wave energy converters. Often in these tests, a real-time realization of prospective control algorithms is applied in order to assess and optimize energy absorption as well as other factors. This paper details the design and execution of an experiment for evaluating the capability of a model-scale WEC to execute basic control algorithms. Model-scale hardware, system, and experimental design are considered, with a focus on providing an experimental setup capable of meeting the dynamic requirements of a control system. To more efficiently execute such tests, a dry bench testing method is proposed and utilized to allow for controller tuning and to give an initial assessment of controller performance; this is followed by wave tank testing. The trends from the dry bench test and wave tank test results show good agreement with theory and confirm the ability of a relatively simple feedback controller to substantially improve energy absorption. Additionally, the dry bench testing approach is shown to be an effective and efficient means of designing and testing both controllers and actuator systems for wave energy converters.},

The main contribution of this paper is the comparison of the performance provided by using either a centralized or decentralized MPC scheme. In this study, it is shown how the inclusion of viscosity and system constraints limits the benefits to be obtained by the use of a centralized control scheme. Indeed, it was shown that a decentralized MPC scheme was sufficient for the provision of close to optimum electrical power extraction from the array when there was a reasonable separation between WEC devices. It was shown that the introduction of power constraints, either locally at each device or globally for the entire array, improved the quality of the power exported to the grid. Importantly, it was shown that from the viewpoint of power quality, global predictive control of the wave energy array offered significant benefits over local decentralized control in increasing the average to peak power ratio of power exported to the grid.},

	abstract = {To facilitate the commercialization of wave energy in an array or farm environment, effective control strategies for improving energy extraction efficiency of the system are important. In this paper, we develop and apply model-predictive control (MPC) to a heaving point-absorber array, where the optimization problem is cast into a convex quadratic programming (QP) formulation, which can be efficiently solved by a standard QP solver. We introduced a term for penalizing large slew rates in the cost function to ensure the convexity of this function. Constraints on both range of the states and the input capacity can be accommodated. The convex formulation reduces the computational hurdles imposed on conventional nonlinear MPC. For illustration of the control principles, a point-absorber approximation is adopted to simplify the representation of the hydrodynamic coefficients among the array by exploiting the small devices to wavelength assumption. The energy-capturing capabilities of a two-cylinder array in regular and irregular waves are investigated. The performance of the MPC for this two-WEC array is compared to that for a single WEC, and the behavior of the individual devices in head or beam wave configuration is explained. Also shown is the reactive power required by the power takeoff system to achieve the performance.},

Wave prediction is obtained using a deterministic propagation model. The paper describes the overall formulation leading up to the derivation of the feedforward control forces in surge and heave, and the control moment in pitch. The radiation coupling between surge and pitch modes is accounted for in the model. Actuation is relative to deeply submerged reaction masses. Heave oscillations are constrained by the swept-volume limit. Oscillation constraints are also applied on the surge and pitch oscillations. The paper discusses time-domain simulations for an irregular wave input with and without the present control. Also discussed are results obtained over a range of irregular wave conditions derived for energy periods from 7s to 17s, and a significant wave height of 1m. It is found that, while the gains in power capture enabled by the present control are significant, the actuation forces are also very large, given the small size of the buoy. Further, due to the small size, heave is found to be the dominant contributor to power capture, with relatively modest contributions from surge and pitch.},

The dynamic model is characterized by a coupling between the pitch and surge modes, while the heave is decoupled. The heave, however, excites the pitch motion through nonlinear parametric excitation in the pitch mode. This paper uses Fourier series (FS) as basis functions to approximate the states and the control. A simplified model is first used where the parametric excitation term is neglected and a closed-form solution for the optimal control is developed. For the parametrically excited case, a sequential quadratic programming approach is implemented to solve for the optimal control numerically. Numerical results show that the harvested energy from three modes is greater than three times the harvested energy from the heave mode alone. Moreover, the harvested energy using a control that accounts for the parametric excitation is significantly higher than the energy harvested when neglecting this nonlinear parametric excitation term.},

In this regard, several wave energy control solutions have been proposed without a clear sign of a straightforward preferred candidate. Therefore, this paper aims at contributing to the wave energy field by proposing a novel WEC control concept, based on an adaptive vectorial approach for achieving maximum power absorption of the wave energy resource. Thanks to the adaptive characteristic of the proposed controller, maximum energy extraction can be achieved at any time regardless of the dominant frequency characteristics of the waves. Finally, the proposed vectorial approach further contributes in reducing the large instantaneous power fluctuations when operating at maximum power extraction conditions.},

	year = {2019},
	abstract = {Real-time control has been widely adopted to enlarge the energy extraction of a wave energy converter (WEC). In order to implement a real-time control, it is necessary to predict the wave excitation forces in the close future. In many previous studies, the wave forces over the prediction horizon were assumed to be already known, while the wave force prediction effect has been hardly examined. In this paper, we investigate the effect of wave force prediction on the energy absorption of a heaving point-absorber WEC with real-time latching control. The real-time control strategy is based on the combination of optimal command theory and first order-one variable grey model. It is shown that a long prediction horizon is beneficial to the energy absorption, whereas the prediction deviation reduces extracting efficiency of the WEC. Further analysis indicates that deviation of wave force amplitude has little influence on the WEC performance. It is the phase deviation that leads to energy loss. Since the prediction deviation accumulates over the horizon, a moderate horizon is, thus, recommended.},

	abstract = {The present research aims to utilize the multi-stable mechanism to increase the energy conversion of the oscillating-body wave energy converter (WEC). Considering that a majority of WEC concepts are linear and single-stable, a nonlinear spring-damper model is proposed to achieve the multi-stable mechanism. The system is either monostable or bistable depending on the initial condition of the springs. The energy conversion of a heaving point-absorber with the nonlinear spring-damper model is investigated in the present research. Firstly, a state-space dynamic model of the heaving point-absorber is developed. Then the energy conversion at both the monostable mode and the bistable mode is simulated. The present research also illustrates the response feature at the two stable modes. It is found the nonlinear point-absorber behaves like a linear system in the monostable mode. The energy conversion is just increased slightly. Nevertheless, the energy absorption is increased substantially in the bistable mode. It is found that the velocity phase is adjusted in the bistable mode, leading to the enhancement of the energy conversion.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, wave energy plays an important role in renewable energy resource. In over 30 years, several researches in wave energy converter system (WEC) have been deployed and carried out. This paper proposes a new mechanism to achieve the resonant behavior of a point absorber floating buoy type of WEC system with mechanical power take-off. The original WEC system uses the bidirectional gearbox to convert up and down motion of the wave in heave mode to one-way rotation. By designing the array of hydraulic springs, the equivalent stiffness of the float can be reduced to close to the relatively low frequency of the wave. Then the buoy is at near resonance with the wave, also increase the power capture bandwidth and the performance of the operating system. In this paper, the specification of the system is proposed and studied. The working principle is analyzed. The mathematical model is then derived to investigate the operation. Experiments are performed to validate the simulation results based on mathematical model. Numerical simulation using Matlab/Simulink has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of the new control stiffness mechanism.},

The CFD model is validated first via wave tank tests and then is applied in this study to investigate the joint effects of device geometry and power take-off (PTO) damping on wave energy absorption. Three PAWEC devices are studied with the following geometrical designs: a cylindrical flat-bottom device (CL); a hemispherical streamlined bottom design (CH) and a 90$\,^{\circ}$-conical streamlined bottom structure (CC). A PTO force via varying damping coefficient is applied to compare the power conversion performances of the aforementioned devices. Free decay, wave-PAWEC interaction and power absorption tests are conducted via the CFD model. The results show that for CH and CC designs the added mass and hydrodynamic damping decrease by up to 60% compared with the CL device. Moreover, the CC design is the best of the three structures since its amplitude response increases by up to 100% compared with the CL. Applying an appropriate PTO damping to the CC device prominently increases the achievable optimal power by up to 70% under both regular and irregular waves (compared with the CL device).},

It consists primarily of a systematic study of the origin and nature of the theoretical limitations on the tolerance and bandwidth of match and of their dependence on the characteristics of the given load impedance. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the physical realizability of a function of frequency representing the input reflection coefficient of a matching network terminated in a prescribed load impedance. These conditions of physical realizability are then transformed into a set of integral relations involving the logarithm of the magnitude of the reflection coefficient. Such relations are particularly suitable for the study of the limitations on the bandwidth and tolerance of match. Definite expressions for these quantities are obtained in special cases. The practical problem of approaching the optimum theoretical tolerance by means of a network with a finite number of elements is also considered. Design curves are provided for a particularly simple but very important type of load impedance. In addition, a very convenient method is presented for computing the values of the elements of the resulting matching network.},

	abstract = {Abstract The wave energy resource for U.S. coastal regions has been estimated at approximately 1,200 TWh/yr (EPRI 2011). The magnitude is comparable to the natural gas and coal energy generation. Although the wave energy industry is relatively new from a commercial perspective, wave energy conversion (WEC) technology is developing at an increasing pace. Ramping up to commercial scale deployment of WEC arrays requires demonstration of performance that is economically competitive with other energy generation methods. The International Electrotechnical Commission has provided technical specifications for developing wave energy resource assessments and characterizations, but it is ultimately up to developers to create pathways for making a specific site competitive. The present study uses example sites to evaluate the annual energy production using different wave energy conversion strategies and examines pathways available to make WEC deployments competitive. The wave energy resource is evaluated for sites along the U.S. coast and combinations of wave modeling and basic resource assessments determine factors affecting the cost of energy at these sites. The results of this study advance the understanding of wave resource and WEC device assessment required to evaluate commercial-scale deployments.},

This paper described the development of a compact hydrodynamic model for the NREL device, based on multiple linear hydrodynamic modelling (Murray-Smith and Johansen, 1997), which can be used to model the hydrodynamic behaviour of the device across its full operational spectrum of vane angles. To show the utility of the model, we demonstrate a flat power curve for the WEC, using the vane angles as a control input.},

The proposed MPC control law consists of two terms: one state feedback gain designed offline to maximize operating range and one term calculated online to maximize the energy output. Compared with the existing MPC strategies developed for the WEC control problem, the proposed feedback economic MPC strategy has the following distinguishing advantages: (i) The satisfaction of safety constraints and the recursive feasibility can be guaranteed to ensure WEC's safe operation in a large range of sea states. (ii) The novel MPC can notably improve energy production efficiency. (iii) The controller design procedure is more convenient and straightforward compared with the existing MPC strategies. The efficacy of the proposed MPC strategy is demonstrated by numerical simulations with a point absorber as a case study. By comparison with a representative existing MPC strategy, the proposed economic MPC can significantly improve energy output.},

The following dynamic analysis is performed depending on the optimum set of parameters but also is constrained by criteria of operation. A maximum capture width ratio of 45% for a standard harmonic wave is achieved, which is comparable with other WECs' performance. Sensitivity tests for the free design parameters of the mechanism are also carried out. For a more realistic scenario of sea states, a specific area's wave time series provided the yearly corresponding duration curves and a second optimization analysis is performed. The attainable average efficiency (stored energy) of the system was almost 20%, showing high sensitivity of the absorbed power on the sea state. In order to increase the annual energy absorption and storage of a single device at real sea conditions, a mechanism for real-time adjustment of the piston pump diameter to better comply with varying wave characteristics, is proposed and modelled. The design of the modified system is optimized again to demonstrate its improved performance and efficiency, which is about 30% higher than the initial design.},

	abstract = {The motion of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) can be described in terms of an integro-differential equation, which includes a convolution term accounting for the radiation forces. Since such a convolution term represents a drawback for both simulation and model-based control, it is usually approximated by a parametric form to be later embedded into the WEC dynamical equation. When an array of WECs is considered, a separate convolution term is required for each cross-coupling component (arising from device interactions), which increases the complexity of the problem. In this paper, a framework to compute a parametric model for array of WEC devices based on moment-matching is presented. The proposed method shows a significant simulation computational saving, compared to other parametric identification methods, which is illustrated by the means of a numerical example.}}

This is generally a nonconvex problem, which can be computationally expensive and converging to a global minimum cannot be guaranteed. We introduce a dual-domain method to relax the nonconvex primal problem into a convex dual optimization problem, which can be performed in real time. Based on previous work, we determine when the duality gap is zero and, by extension, whether the global optimal primal solution is found. We demonstrate the algorithm on a single, buoy-type wave energy converter with energy storage constraints and power take-off force constraints.}}

This study applies a recent robust approach for spectral and pseudospectral methods to a wave energy converter, considering structured uncertainty in the dynamical system. The results show that the robust approach gives better worst-case performance than an equivalent non-robust approach. Additionally, when structured uncertainty is considered in the dynamical system, the results show that the absorbed energy, obtained with the robust approach, is always positive. Finally, the advantages of this new approach are commented.}}

These interacting hydrodynamic structures require an optimised process that can ensure the maximum extraction of time-averaged energy from ocean waves, while respecting the physical limitations of each device and actuator characteristics. Recently, a novel optimal control framework based on the concept of moment, for a single WEC device, has been introduced in [1]. Such a strategy offers an energy-maximising computationally efficient solution that can systematically incorporate state and input constraints. This paper presents the mathematical extension of the optimal control framework of [1] to the case where an array of WECs is considered, providing an efficient solution that exploits the hydrodynamic interaction between devices to maximise the total absorbed energy.}}

	abstract = {A new technique is proposed for the design of nonlinear causal feedback controllers for wave energy converters, which explicitly protect against stroke saturation. The technique is an improvement of a technique originally proposed in [1]. The primary challenge associated with the problem is the design of nonlinear controllers for which global closed-loop stability can be assured with probability 1 for stationary stochastic response, without also unduly sacrificing power generation performance. The proposed technique consists of three steps: 1) designing a linear feedback controller using multi-objective optimization techniques; 2) augmenting this design with an extra input channel that adheres to a closed-loop passivity condition; and 3) designing an outer, nonlinear passive feedback loop that controls this augmented input in such a way as to ensure stroke limits are maintained. The primary contribution of this paper is a fundamental improvement to the second of these steps, for which the previous technique was not guaranteed to return a valid solution. The proposed technique, by contrast, is shown to always produce a nonlinear controller with the desired properties, under very general modeling assumptions. The technique is illustrated on a simple heaving-buoy wave energy converter example.}}

For fast computation, these numerical models are mostly based on low-fidelity boundary element method (BEM) codes and linear hydrodynamic models. However, to ensure optimal performance in a physical environment, more realistic, high-fidelity numerical frameworks, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based numerical wave tanks (CNWTs), should be considered during the evaluation of EMCSs. This paper investigates the influence of different numerical evaluation frameworks on the performance evaluation of EMCSs. The Wavestar WEC, subject to three different EMCSs with varying aggressiveness, i.e. resistive, reactive and moment-based control, is chosen as the case study. Results show that more aggressive EMCSs require high-fidelity numerical modelling to correctly evaluate their performance.}}

To facilitate convergence, and thereby support commercialization, we present a new simple method for analysis and comparison of alternative device architectures at an early stage of the design process. Using Th{\'e}venin's theorem, Falnes crafted an ingenious solution for the monochromatic optimal power capture of heaving point absorber devices by forming a mechanical impedance matching problem between the device and the power take-off. However, his solutions are limited by device architecture complexity. In this paper, we use the mechanical circuit framework to extend Falnes' method to form and solve the impedance matching problem and calculate the optimal power capture for converter architectures of arbitrary complexity. The new technique is first applied to reprove Falnes' findings and then to assess a complex converter architecture, proposed by Korde. This work also provides insight into a master-slave relationship between the geometry and power take-off force control problems that are inherent to converter design, and it reveals a hierarchy of distinct design objectives unbeknownst to Korde for his device. Finally, we show how application of the master-slave principle leads to the reduction in the dimensionality of the associated design space.},

	abstract = {To be a competitive supply of renewable energy, the power capture performance of ocean wave energy converters must improve. This requires that wave energy converter designers identify and invest resources to develop devices that exhibit a strong Technology Performance Level early in the development process. We contend that completing this identification process at the conceptual design stage requires a generalized method to establish the power capture upper bound for any given wave energy converter architecture. This upper bound must reflect simultaneous implementation of both optimal geometry control and power take-off force control -- components known to be essential to optimizing performance but difficult to envision for complex WEC architectures. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a procedure, built on the mechanical circuit framework, to identify this upper bound for a self-reacting point absorber with an inertial modulation mechanism performing the geometry control. We illustrate how the analytical procedure generates generic design guidance, required to achieve the bound, without committing to a specific technology. We follow by formally introducing a new technology into the wave energy community, the inerter, capable of implementing the design guidance to enact the required geometry control. Finally, we apply the analytics within a numerical case study of a previously published wave energy converter configuration, and compare the power capture production of that device to one with equivalent hydrodynamics, but with the new geometry control feature set suggested by the new analytical procedure. Our analysis reveals the potential for a ten-fold increase in power capture even under stringent relative displacement constraints.},

Many WEF estimators have been proposed based on stochastic PAWEC modeling using the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), or receding-horizon estimation. Alternatively, a deterministic WEF estimator is proposed here based on the fast unknown input estimation (FUIE) concept. The WEF is estimated as an unknown input obviating the requirement to represent its dynamics. The proposed observer-based unknown input estimator (OBUIE) inherits the capability of estimating fast-changing signals from the FUIE, which is important when considering irregular wave conditions. Unlike preceding methods, the OBUIE is designed based on a PAWEC model, including the nonlinear viscous drag force. It has been shown that the nonlinear viscous drag force is essential for accurate PAWEC model description, within the energy maximization control role. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated in terms of PAWEC conversion efficiency in a single degree-of-freedom PAWEC device operating in regular and irregular waves. Simulation results are obtained using MATLAB to evaluate the estimator under different control methods and subject to parametric uncertainty.},

Different concepts and methods have been suggested by many researchers to harvest ocean wave energy. This paper reviews and compares the efficiencies and power performance of different wave energy converters. The types of analyses used in deriving the reported efficiencies are identified, and the stage of the power conversion processes at which the efficiencies were determined is also identified. In order to find a common way to compare the efficiencies of different technologies, the hydrodynamic efficiency in relation to the characteristic width of the wave energy converters and the wave resource potential are chosen in this paper. The results show that the oscillating body systems have the highest ratio in terms of the efficiency per characteristic width, and overtopping devices have the lowest. In addition, with better understanding of the devices&rsquo; dynamics, the efficiencies of the newer oscillating water column and body systems would increase as the potential wave energy level increases, which shows that those newer designs could be suitable for more potential locations with large variations in wave energy potentials. At last, discussion about the cost of ocean wave energy is presented as well.},

	abstract = {The research presented in this paper investigates novel ways of optimizing all-electric wave energy converters for maximum wave-to-wire efficiency. In addition, a novel velocity-based controller is presented which was designed specifically for wave-to-wire efficiency maximization. In an ideal wave energy converter system, maximum efficiency in power conversion is achieved by maximizing the hydrodynamic efficiency of the floating body. However, in a real system, that involves losses at different stages from wave to grid, and the global wave-to-wire optimum differs from the hydrodynamic one. For that purpose, a full wave-to-wire wave energy converter that uses a direct-drive permanent magnet linear generator was modelled in detail. The modelling aspect included complex hydrodynamic simulations using Edinburgh Wave Systems Simulation Toolbox and the electrical modelling of the generator, controllers, power converters and the power transmission side with grid connection in MATLAB/Simulink. Three reference controllers were developed based on the previous literature: a real damping, a reactive spring damping and a velocity-based controller. All three literature-based controllers were optimized for maximum wave-to-wire efficiency for a specific wave energy resource profile. The results showed the advantage of using reactive power to bring the velocity of the point absorber and the wave excitation force in phase, which was done directly using the velocity-based controller, achieving higher efficiencies. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that maximizing hydrodynamic energy capture may not lead to maximum wave-to-wire efficiency. Finally, the controllers were also tested in random sea states, and their performance was evaluated.},

	abstract = {Sea wave energy converter control is a non-causal optimal control problem, and the control performance relies on the accuracy of wave prediction information. However, the existing wave prediction methods, such as Auto-Regressive (AR) method, extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Artificial neural network (ANN) and deterministic sea wave prediction (DSWP), inevitably introduce prediction errors. This paper presents a robust non-causal linear optimal control of wave energy converters to explicitly cope with the prediction error of sea wave prediction and simultaneously compensate the modelling uncertainty caused by wave force approximations. This is achieved by designing a non-causal linear optimal control (LOC) to maximize the energy output and a sliding mode control (SMC) to compensate unmodeled WEC dynamics and wave prediction error. The parameters of both SMC and non-causal LOC are calculated off-line, which significantly enhances the real-time implementation of the proposed controller with reasonably low computational load. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.},

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely studied control approach that has strong potential for successful application to ocean wave energy conversion. It combines a predictive element, which is necessary for optimal wave energy conversion, along with consideration of system limitations, which is extremely important when operating within the very large forces present in ocean hydrodynamics. This paper presents MPC formulation and experimental testing, applied to the 1/15th scale Azura wave energy converter developed and tested by Northwest Energy Innovations (NWEI). The results demonstrate successful prototype testing, with MPC providing an average increase in power production of 36% over standard fixed damping for six cases of sea states.},

The standard problem involves maximizing the absorbed power from oncoming waves while respecting motion constraints of the device and force constraints of the power take-off (PTO). The generated electrical power is then calculated by assuming an ideal PTO with no power conversion losses or limitations to power flow. In this article, we remove the assumption of an ideal PTO and present four different control options that reflect unique combinations of PTO control and power flow constraints. We also recast the MPC problem to maximize the generated power instead of the absorbed power by accounting for the losses in the power train. Using a WEC with a hydraulic PTO, we develop a loss model suitable for controls optimization. Finally, we illustrate the process of setting up the non-linear MPC problem and compare the performance of competing control strategies using a common benchmark based on annual energy captured at a reference site.},

	abstract = {This study compares the response of a submerged CETO-shaped point absorber wave energy converter using linear, partially-nonlinear, pseudo-nonlinear, and fully-nonlinear methods to model hydrodynamic effects. Linear potential flow models calculate hydrodynamic parameters to represent the fluid-structure interaction; typical dynamic models apply these parameters without pose-dependence. The partially-nonlinear method evaluates excitation forces at different poses to introduce a pose-dependent excitation force; in addition to the excitation force, the pseudo-nonlinear method calculates hydrodynamic coefficients using linear potential flow methods and includes pose-dependence through interpolating pre-calculated parameters to represent the radiation force. The fully-nonlinear CFD model is a numerical wave tank validated against published data. The applicability of linear-based methods has been explored by comparing the motion, force, and power of the system under various operating conditions against the fully-nonlinear results. It was expected that for low amplitude waves results tend towards the linear results; however, for both low amplitude waves and increased submergence depth, linear methods provided poor representations of the nonlinear CFD results. Geometric nonlinearities were insufficient to capture all the nonlinear behaviour. A frequency-dependent nonlinearity was identified in the water above the buoy resonating. For such submerged point absorbers, linear methods do not adequately represent the influential nonlinear effects.},

As a result, it is required to conduct a large number of time domain simulations that are computationally expensive. The following study presents the application of a fast and high-fidelity alternative technique, named statistical linearization (SL), that can be used for the stochastic analysis of nonlinear wave energy converters. The method consists of an approximate solution that allows one to quickly estimate the contribution of nonlinear terms using a probabilistic model. The application of the statistical linearization is demonstrated using three conceptually different wave energy converters, a point absorber, an oscillating wave surge converter, and an oscillating water column, with distinct nonlinear dynamics. The performance of SL is assessed against nonlinear time-domain simulations in terms of spatial response distributions and power spectral densities of responses and excitation loads, mean offsets, mean absorbed power and equivalent linear terms. The results show a good agreement between the two types of models for all wave energy converters considered, while showing that SL is approximately 3 to 4 orders of magnitude faster than the time domain model.},

	abstract = {Abstract Over the last few decades, control engineers have focused on developing innovative control theories and algorithms to regulate systems. These control efforts are usually at the last stage of a sequential strategy that allows engineering departments to work independently and consecutively toward the design of new products and systems. Control algorithms are usually developed at the end of that sequential process, once the mechanical, electrical, and other subsystems are completely defined. This paper discusses a different approach, named Control Co-Design (CCD). Following a concurrent engineering strategy that considers multidisciplinary subsystem interactions from the beginning of the design process, CCD applies control concepts to design the entire system and reach optimal solutions that are not achievable otherwise. This approach is a game changer for the control engineer, who will be not only the designer of advanced control algorithms but also the natural leader of the design of new products and systems. This paper describes some historic engineering breakthroughs achieved by applying CCD and explores some relevant application areas. It also presents three complementary CCD methodologies that include control-inspired paradigms, formal mathematical co-optimization techniques, and co-simulation campaigns to enhance engineering creativity and achieve radically new optimal designs.},

This article facilitates the use of these compensators by providing explicit formulas that relate the parameters of the compensators to features of their frequency responses. Two examples illustrate the utility of these compensators for system modeling and controller design. While the examples involve low-order plants, the principles of employing the complex lead and lag compensators remain the same for higher-order systems. We plan to use these compensators as weighting functions with automated robust design tools. A weighting function is a transfer function whose frequency response magnitude is used to bound closed-loop response or modeling uncertainty. The complex lead and lag compensators provide new degree of freedom for selecting weighting functions. In particular, the steep magnitude slope in the transition region of these compensators more closely approximates an ideal step function than weighting functions appearing in the literature (Packard et al.)},

	abstract = {In this study, the effectiveness of an oscillating-body WEC with a tuned inerter (TI) proposed by the authors is shown through wave flume testing. The TI mechanism consisting of a tuning spring, a rotational inertial mass, and a viscous damping component is able to increase energy absorption capability by taking advantage of the resonance effect of the rotational mass. This mechanism has been recently introduced for civil structures subjected to external loadings such as earthquakes and winds to decay vibration response immediately. The authors applied this mechanism to oscillating-body WECs and showed that the proposed WEC increased the power generation performance and broadened the effective frequency range without increasing the mass of the buoy itself through numerical simulation studies. To verify the validity of the proposed WEC experimentally, a small-scale prototype of the proposed device is designed and wave flume testing is carried out with various regular wave inputs of different frequencies. The results show that the WEC with the properly adjusted TI mechanism demonstrates better power generation performance compared to the conventional WEC over a wide range of wave frequencies.},

	abstract = {This paper extends the theory on capture width, a commonly used performance indicator for a wave energy converter (WEC). The capture width of a linear WEC is shown to depend on two properties: the spectral power fraction (a property introduced in this paper), which depends entirely on the sea state, and the monochromatic capture width, which is determined by the geometry of the WEC and the chosen power take off (PTO) coefficients. Each of these properties is examined in detail. Capture width is shown to be a measure of how well these two properties coincide. A study of the effects of PTO control on the capture width suggests that geometry control, a form of control that has not been the focus of much academic research, despite its use in the wave energy industry, deserves more attention. The distinction between geometry control and PTO control is outlined. While capture width is a valuable design tool, its limitations must be recognised. The assumptions made in the formulation of capture width are listed, and its limitations as a tool for estimating annual power capture of a WEC are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper we derive a formulation for Model Predictive Control (MPC) of linear time-invariant systems based on H-infinity loop-shaping. The design provides an optimized stability margin for problems that require state estimation. Input and output weights are designed in the frequency domain to satisfy steady-state and transient performance requirements, in lieu of conventional MPC plant model augmentations. The H-infinity loop-shaping synthesis results in an observer-based state feedback structure. Using the linear state feedback law, an inverse optimal control problem is solved to design the MPC cost function, and the H-infinity state estimator is used to initialize the prediction model at each time step. The MPC inherits the closed-loop performance and stability margin of the loop-shaped design when constraints are inactive. We apply the methodology to a multi-zone heat pump system in simulation. The design rejects constant unmeasured disturbances and tracks constant references with zero steady-state error, has good transient performance, provides an excellent stability margin, and enforces input and output constraints.},

	abstract = {A two-stage gradient method (TGM) based on traditional backward integration is firstly proposed for solving two-stage nonlinear optimal control problem with arbitrary performance index and unspecified switching time. To reduce the computational cost, pseudospectral collocation scheme is embedded so as to transfer a family of time-varying influence function dynamics into a set of linear algebraic equations. Therefore, a series of symbolic formulation can be analytically derived to efficiently calculate the influence functions. Also, some special integrals using to update the improvements can be efficiently determined by Gaussian Quadrature. Finally, the performance of both TGMs is investigated with reduced-order reentry trajectory planning problem. The results show that both methods only take a few steps to find the solution satisfying the necessary condition for optimality and terminal constraints. Furthermore, the TGM with pseudospectral collocation scheme considerably improves the computational efficiency and has the potential to be applicable in the framework of real-time guidance.},

	abstract = {Power estimation is the most important task in the performance assessment of wave energy converters (WEC). Depending on the type of WEC, power take-off (PTO) system, and available instrumentation, different approaches are usually applied to assess power from experimental tests. Since neither for tests execution nor for the analyses exist standard methodologies, the estimated power can significantly differ among the approaches, thus, introducing inaccuracies in the assessment of the WEC's performance. This study analyzed an extensive set of experimental results of a WEC and applied different power estimation approaches to compare and validate the obtained results. The strengths and weaknesses of those methodologies were analyzed and discussed. The major outcomes were: (a) PTO damping characterization based on bench tests can lead to unrealistic values of the WEC's absorbed power; (b) the hybrid (experimental plus numerical) approach provide more reliable results than the traditional ones; (c) the kinetic energy harvester approach underestimates power but can be useful for preliminary qualitative performance assessments; (d) the new proposed gross efficiency index allows the definition of upper boundaries for wave power conversion as well as the identification of the wave conditions for which WEC performance can be improved.},

	abstract = {Variable renewable energy (VRE) generation from wind and sun is growing quickly in Europe. Already today, VRE's power contribution is at times close to the total demand in some regions with severe consequences for the remainder of the power system. Grid extensions are necessary for the physical integration of VRE, i.e., for power transports, but they also have important economic consequences for all power system participants. We employ a regional, power system model to examine the role of grid extensions for the market effects of VRE in Europe. We derive cost-optimal macroscopic transmission grid extensions for the projected wind and solar capacities in Europe in 2020 and characterize their effects on the power system with high regional and technological resolution. Without grid extensions, lower electricity prices, new price dynamics and reduced full load hours for conventional generation technologies result in proximity to high VRE capacities. This leads to substantial changes in the projected achievable revenues of utilities. Grid extensions partially alleviate and redistribute these effects, mainly for the benefit of baseload and the VRE technologies themselves.},

However, high shares of these variable renewable energies (VREs) challenge the power system considerably due to their temporal fluctuations and geographical dispersion. In this paper, we systematically analyze transmission grid extensions as an integration measure for VREs in Europe. We show the effects of grid extensions for fundamental properties of the power system as a function of the penetration and mix of wind and solar energy. Backup capacity requirements and overproduction are reduced with a powerful overlay transmission grid. We determine the costs of the grid extensions in dependence of the VRE penetration and mix and find that the grid integration costs remain below 25% of the VRE investment costs for all conceivable VRE configurations. Furthermore, robust design features of future power systems in terms of grid geometry and flexibility requirements for backup technologies are identified. We apply a spatially and temporally highly resolved techno-economic model of the European power system for our analysis.},

	abstract = {The main objective in hydrodynamic control of wave energy converters (WECs) is the maximization of the energy captured from the waves. Latching control, model predictive control and ``PI'' control are examples of implementable strategies surveyed in the literature. ``PI'' control is the common name of a form of hydrodynamic control where the control force applied to the captor is a proportional-integral feedback of captor velocity. While suboptimal, it has the merit of being simple, requiring only straightforward computations and can be considered a standard solution for WECs with a four-quadrant power takeoff (PTO) system. Adaptive ``PI'' control has been already discussed in the literature, usually using a gain-scheduling approach, with optimal gains precomputed off-line for a representative set of sea states and applied as a function of estimated sea state conditions. In most literature, only average on-line estimations of sea states have been proposed, with time windows of several minutes. Such intermittent adaptive control laws are clearly suboptimal in terms of energy recovery, since the control gains are not continuously updated whereas the sea state is continuously time-varying. In this paper we present a continuously adaptive ``PI'' control strategy, whose gains are adapted on-line on a wave-to-wave basis, based on a real-time estimate of the dominant wave frequency of the wave force. The PTO efficiency is taken into account. The proposed control method is validated and compared through experiment for irregular sea states.},

	abstract = {The highest efficiency of wave energy capture by point absorbers is attained under conditions close to resonance. In most cases, the natural frequency of resonance is higher than the typical frequency of the waves. Reactive phase control has been proposed to improve these situations. Reactive power contributes nothing to the average delivered power and is back-and-forth exchange of energy between the power take-off system (PTO) and the oscillating system. Apart from larger peaks in PTO forces and power, a major drawback of reactive phase control is the energy loss by dissipative processes inherent to the back-and-forth energy exchange, especially if the magnitude of such exchanged energy is comparable to, or even significantly larger than, the net absorbed energy, which may be the case in point absorbers. The paper considers a floating axisymmetric two-body wave energy converter constrained to oscillate in heave in deep water. The outer body is a buoy, whereas the inner body is a long surface-piercing cylinder against whose inertia the outer floater reacts. The PTO converts the relative motion between the two bodies and the associated forces into useful energy. The basic equations in the frequency domain for the reactively controlled two-body converter performance in regular waves are presented for an imperfectly efficient PTO. If the inner cylindrical body is fixed, the equations are reduced to a single-degree-of-freedom. The analysis is extended to irregular waves characterized by a variance density spectrum. Numerical results are presented for regular and irregular waves, including reactive control optimization.},

A typical efficient energy conversion system for point absorbers is based on hydraulic power take-off (PTO) systems, consisting in a double-acting cylinder, a hydraulic motor and two or more accumulators. This paper presents a simple model of a heaving oscillating buoy extracting power by means of a hydraulic system. The hydrodynamic behaviour of the absorber is modelled through application of the linear water wave theory. Apart from the basic elements listed above, the model of the hydraulic system includes leakages and pressure losses and takes into account the compressibility of the fluid. Also, possible control accumulators are considered in order to improve the performance of the hydraulic system by means of properly controlled valves. Different control variables are analysed depending on the wave inputs considered in order to improve the power extraction of the converter. The results prove that it is possible to achieve a great enhancement of the power extraction with the implementation of these control strategies and that a possible combination of some of them might be beneficial for improved efficiency of the components.},

In this paper, we assess the consequences of continued SLR for 84 coastal developing countries. Geographic Information System (GIS) software has been used to overlay the best available, spatially disaggregated global data on critical impact elements (land, population, agriculture, urban extent, wetlands, and GDP), with the inundation zones projected for 1-5 m SLR. Our results reveal that tens of millions of people in the developing world are likely to be displaced by SLR within this century; and accompanying economic and ecological damage will be severe for many. At the country level results are extremely skewed, with severe impacts limited to a relatively small number of countries.},

This paper describes the hydraulic power take-off system employed in the Pelamis wave energy converter. The process of the system's development is presented, including simulation and laboratory tests at 1/7th and fullscale. Results of efficiency measurements are also presented.},

The controller tunes the oscillation of the system such that it is always in phase with the wave excitation force and the amplitude of the oscillation is within given constraints. Based on a nonstationary, harmonic approximation of the wave excitation force, the controller is easily tuned in real-time for performance and constraints handling, through one single parameter of direct physical meaning. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is assessed for a heaving system in one degree of freedom, in a variety of irregular (simulated and real) wave conditions. A performance close to reactive control and to model predictive control is achieved. Additional benefits in terms of simplicity and robustness are obtained.},

The concept of the control is to cancel all or part of the reactive terms in the equation of motion. The proposed control is causal, thus it may be applied in practice. Actuators efficiencies from 50 to 100\% are considered. The methodology used in the study relies on mathematical and numerical modeling. Control performance is investigated in regular waves and in irregular waves, and also from the perspective of the annual mean absorbed power at a typical Western Atlantic site. Motion constraints are not taken into account in the analysis for sake of simplicity. As already shown in previous work, it is found that reactive control can increase the mean annual power absorption at the considered site by a factor 10 in case of ideal actuators. However, it is shown that actuators efficiency is critical to control performance, because of the large amount of reactive power involved in the control strategy. Thus, for low efficiencies actuators ({\textless}80\%), control performance is a fraction of what it can be with ideal actuators (approximately 10\%). Even with 90\% efficiency, control performance is less than 30\% of the ideal case. In the range 90--100\%, every percent of increase in efficiency leads to significant increase in control performance.},

	abstract = {The amount of energy that a wave energy converter can extract depends strongly on the control strategy applied to the power take-off system. It is well known that, ideally, the reactive control allows for maximum energy extraction from waves. However, the reactive control is intrinsically noncausal in practice and requires some kind of causal approach to be applied. Moreover, this strategy does not consider physical constraints and this could be a problem because the system could achieve unacceptable dynamic values. These, and other control techniques have focused on the wave energy extraction problem in order to maximize the energy absorbed by the power take-off device without considering the possible losses in intermediate devices. In this sense, a reactive control that considers the linear generator copper losses has been recently proposed to increase the useful power injected into the grid. Among the control techniques that have emerged recently, the model predictive control represents a promising strategy. This approach performs an optimization process on a time prediction horizon incorporating dynamic constraints associated with the physical features of the power take-off system. This paper proposes a model predictive control technique that considers the copper losses in the control optimization process of point absorbers with direct drive linear generators. This proposal makes the most of reactive control as it considers the copper losses, and it makes the most of the model predictive control, as it considers the system constraints. This means that the useful power transferred from the linear generator to the power converters increases. In this sense, the average power delivered to the grid increases and the implementation viability improves. In this paper, the results of the simulations are compared with those obtained from other control strategies in irregular waves.},

	abstract = {Wave energy converters (WECs) are traditionally designed independently of control systems. This usually involves matching the device frequency response to the predominant sea spectrum of a specific site. Energy maximizing control systems are subsequently employed to improve the energy conversion of the device for sea states other than the design sea state. It is well known that some control techniques have the ability to change the characteristics of a wave energy device, allowing it to improve the power absorption for frequencies other than the device natural frequency. However, while the controllers do their best to broaden the device frequency response, they can be limited in their capability to produce an overall optimal system. A different approach is studied in this paper, where iteration is performed between geometry optimization and control design. The aim is to investigate the implications of geometry optimization in the absence of control and the ultimate effect of incorporating the control design at the geometry optimization stage. Unconstrained control strategies are considered, namely, latching, declutching, and a model predictive control-like algorithm. It is shown that different optimal WEC geometries can be obtained depending on whether the device is controlled or not and the type of controller employed. The differences in overall power absorption characteristics of the optimized geometries are presented.},

The goal of this paper is to show how a convenient tradeoff between high-power extraction and viable electrical device rating can be achieved by a proper choice of the WEC control strategy. Referring to a direct coupled point absorber in heave operating in regular waves, it will be analytically shown how most common control techniques impact on both the power performance and the power takeoff (PTO) rating. Thus, a tool that can assist in the preliminary PTO sizing by taking into account the main constraints imposed by the application is obtained. Following, an adaptive control strategy including a reactive component is proposed, whose goal is to improve the overall system performance when the WEC is already operative in the sea. Its effectiveness in increasing the average power extraction while respecting the PTO peak power constraint is proved by computer simulations in both regular and irregular waves, and specific analyses also including the PTO force/torque limitation are finally developed.},

Less developed at present than other renewables, the existing models to estimate the costs of a wave energy project are often oversimplified, and the resulting scatter in the economic assessments weighs on the confidence of potential investors and constitutes therefore an impediment to the development of wave energy. Indeed, understanding the costs of wave energy is one of the main fields of research in marine renewable energy. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to review all the factors that must be considered in an economic analysis of wave energy, including a number of elements that are usually overlooked. In the process we characterise the direct and indirect costs of a wave farm -- preliminary costs, construction, operation and maintenance and decommissioning cost -- as well as its prospective incomes. For each of them a reference value is presented, together with a generic formula for its calculation. Moreover, the levelised cost, i.e., the production cost of an energy unit (1kWh), is compared between various energy sources, and on these grounds conclusions on the profitability and competitiveness of wave energy are drawn. In sum, this work reviews the state of the art and sets the basis for a thorough economic analysis of wave energy.},

	abstract = {Small scale testing in controlled environments is a key stage in the development of potential wave energy conversion technology. Furthermore, it is well known that the physical design and operational quality of the power-take off (PTO) used on the small scale model can have vast effects on the tank testing results. Passive mechanical elements such as friction brakes and air dampers or oil filled dashpots are fraught with nonlinear behaviors such as static friction, temperature dependency, and backlash, the effects of which propagate into the wave energy converter (WEC) power production data, causing very high uncertainty in the extrapolation of the tank test results to the meaningful full ocean scale. The lack of quality in PTO simulators is an identified barrier to the development of WECs worldwide. A solution to this problem is to use actively controlled actuators for PTO simulation on small scale model wave energy converters. This can be done using force (or torque)-controlled feedback systems with suitable instrumentation, enabling the PTO to exert any desired time and/or state dependent reaction force. In this paper, two working experimental PTO simulators on two different wave energy converters are described. The first implementation is on a 1:25 scale self-reacting point absorber wave energy converter with optimum reactive control. The real-time control system, described in detail, is implemented in LabVIEW. The second implementation is on a 1:20 scale single body point absorber under model-predictive control, implemented with a real-time controller in MATLAB/Simulink. Details on the physical hardware, software, and feedback control methods, as well as results, are described for each PTO. Lastly, both sets of real-time control code are to be web-hosted, free for download, modified and used by other researchers and WEC developers.},

To facilitate convergence, and thereby support commercialization, we present a new simple method for analysis and comparison of alternative device architectures at an early stage of the design process. Using Th{\'e}venin's theorem, Falnes crafted an ingenious solution for the monochromatic optimal power capture of heaving point absorber devices by forming a mechanical impedance matching problem between the device and the power take-off. However, his solutions are limited by device architecture complexity. In this paper, we use the mechanical circuit framework to extend Falnes' method to form and solve the impedance matching problem and calculate the optimal power capture for converter architectures of arbitrary complexity. The new technique is first applied to reprove Falnes' findings and then to assess a complex converter architecture, proposed by Korde. This work also provides insight into a master-slave relationship between the geometry and power take-off force control problems that are inherent to converter design, and it reveals a hierarchy of distinct design objectives unbeknownst to Korde for his device. Finally, we show how application of the master-slave principle leads to the reduction in the dimensionality of the associated design space.},
